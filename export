Initially, he wasn't concerned; the plant used the remote-access software TeamViewer to allow staff to share screens and troubleshoot IT issues, and his boss often connected to his computer to monitor the facility's systems.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut a few hours later, police say, the plant operator noticed his mouse moving out of his control again. This time there would be no illusion of benign monitoring from a supervisor or IT person. The cursor began clicking through the water treatment plant's controls. Within seconds, the intruder was attempting to change the water supply's levels of sodium hydroxide, also known as lye or caustic soda, moving the setting from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million. In low concentrations the corrosive chemical regulates the PH level of potable water. At high levels, it severely damages any human tissue it touches.\r\n\r\nAccording to city officials, the operator quickly spotted the intrusion and returned the sodium hydroxide to normal levels. Even if he hadn't, the poisoned water would have taken 24 to 36 hours to reach the city's population, and automated PH testing safeguards would have triggered an alarm and caught the change before anyone was harmed",

Anyway...\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting attack, because the bug in question is present by design in pretty much all dependency resolution software.  If you specify that you want somepackage with at least version 1.1.0, then they will search your private repositories for the package, but also public repositories for that package.  Some can be configured (or easily misconfigured) to prefer packages that they find from the internet over private packages.  Others all behave the same way when presented with newer or higher version numbered packages on public repositories.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism of getting packages into the build chain is ingenious, but I\u2019m a bit suspicious of Birsan\u2019s methods here though.  He uploaded these packages to a volunteer  run public repository, and those packages had malicious code that even went as far as to use DNS as the exfiltration route.  I think that crosses a line in ethical security research, because he cannot know enough about the internals of the build systems to be confident that he wasn\u2019t breaking the build system (likely given he replaced a library it depended on), and that he wasn\u2019t corrupting builds or systems further downstream.\r\n\r\nThe companies all paid out, and paid out handsomely, so I guess they felt it was a valid find of a serious vulnerability though.  It would be nice if, as the researcher, he also felt obliged to contribute code to these open source packaging systems that would close that vulnerability or make it clearer to users when they had misconfigured their systems.",

If you think you\u2019ve found a vulnerability, but the company wont take you seriously, how can you demonstrate how bad it is without exploiting it and without doing any damage?  You\u2019d think, and hope, that companies have sensible, tech aware people responding to vulnerability reports who understand the impact of the vulnerability and can treat them seriously, but the reality is that most of the reports I\u2019ve seen come in are from generic scanners which makes reading them dull and uninteresting, and not a great use of your best talent.  That means you need a process and a system, and the first person in it is unlikely to see the importance of the issue at first.\r\n\r\nBut even more than that, how do we deal with the ethical dilemma of organisations that choose not to play fairly?  I\u2019ve covered before that Google\u2019s Project Zero has a really harsh disclosure timeline and they really don\u2019t like to extend it, meaning that you need to be able to fix your issue within the timeline.  But researchers who don\u2019t have that weight behind them can find it harder when they are fobbed off and delayed by the company.  And it gets worse if the company accuses them of extortion, provides legal threats and otherwise acts belligerently to the researcher.  We\u2019ve seen it before and we\u2019ll see it again I\u2019m sure.\r\n\r\nBut does that mean that future security researchers should simply ignore the [\u201ccorrect\u201d responsible disclosure process](https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/ISO/ISOIEC291472018), or does it mean that the company should be given additional chances by researchers?\r\n\r\nFinally, is it fine to act as a vulnerability researcher, finding holes in open source software, without providing the support needed to help fix that software?  We wouldn\u2019t expect it for commercial software, but volunteer run software might need some thinking about how we [ensure that fixes are done](https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/1359855371431653377?s=21).\r\n\r\nNone of this is simple, and as we as an industry increasingly ask ourselves [ethical questions about software engineering itself](https://qconlondon.com/topics/tech-ethics), we need to include conversations about the right ethical lines around vulnerability research, disclosure and so on.",

In 2008, Russia got into a network at the Pentagon; hackers broke into the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain; the next year, North Korea compromised the Web sites of everything from the Treasury Department to the New York Stock Exchange. In 2010, a computer worm called Stuxnet, created by the U.S. and Israel in an operation approved by George W. Bush and continued by Obama, was discovered to have devastated Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Perlroth, who started covering cybersecurity for the Times a year later, is arguing that, if you build a worm like that, it\u2019s eventually going to come back and eat you.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Iranian hackers destroyed the data of thirty thousand computers used by a Saudi oil company. That year, Republicans in the Senate filibustered a law that would have required American companies to meet minimum cybersecurity regulations. Two years later, North Korean hackers attacked Sony. (As Perlroth observes, the press coverage mainly concerned gossip that was found in Sony executives\u2019 e-mails, not North Korea\u2019s ability to hack into American companies.) Russia, in the same period, was \u201cimplanting itself into the American grid,\u201d hacking into systems that controlled basic infrastructure, from pipelines to power switches. By 2015, Russians were inside the State Department, the White House, and the Pentagon. The hackers didn\u2019t turn things off; they just sat there, waiting. Beginning in 2014, in anticipation of the 2016 election, they fomented civil unrest through fake Twitter and Facebook accounts, sowing disinformation. They broke into the computers of the Democratic National Committee. As with the Sony attack, the press mostly reported the gossip found in the e-mails of people like John Podesta. All the while, as Perlroth emphasizes, Russian hackers were also invading election and voter-registration systems in every state in the country. Donald Trump\u2019s response, once he was in office, was to deny that the Russians had done anything at all, and to get rid of the White House cybersecurity co\u00f6rdinator.",

That story from Bloomberg that there was chinese malware in SuperMicro motherboards that could entirely compromise computers from below the operating system for which there was a lot of very strong denials from almost everyone involved.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve raised a few times that my distrust of major newspapers is based not only on 7 years of working for one, but because of the so-called [gell-man amnesia effect](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/65213-briefly-stated-the-gell-mann-amnesia-effect-is-as-follows-you), which is that when we read a major \u201ctrustworthy\u201d newspaper article on area of our expertise, we notice all the flaws and lack of detailed expertise, but we trust newspapers on the next page over.\r\n\r\nWhile not entirely accurate, as newspaper journalists on politics and international desks actually often are experts on their area, but within technology and cybersecurity, its certainly the case that big names doesn\u2019t always mean accuracy.  Firstly, you can never be sure who wrote the story.  Some newspapers have some very good tech reporters who understand the technology, but often when a big story breaks, it tends to be given to the big name journalists to cover and write, not the technology desk.\r\n\r\nBut this creates real problems for us when we consume news.  As I pointed out last week with the link to the [Axios Codebook](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-codebook-b04bf6f5-5c30-45ba-95b9-fbe944b6a668.html), our news reporting also suffers from an availability bias.  We only get to hear about cyber operations that the news sources we follow will raise, so those reporters are focused on certain countries, you wont get to read about attacks carried out by other countries.  And of course, a good nation state, espionage motivated cyber attack should never be known about, so we almost certainly don\u2019t know about some portion of the attacks.  Worse, we probably don\u2019t even know how many of few we know about... do we miss just 10% or do we miss 90%?\r\n\r\nThis bias means that it can be really difficult when a news story breaks to work out what action we should be taking.  If you believe the news at surface value, the most recent attack was almost entirely SolarWinds related.  But there\u2019s quiet threads you can pick up, as Gizmodo have, that shows that it\u2019s very likely that the same actor has been carrying out a far more complex campaign than is really noticed.  Many of us have already forgotten that this all started with the discovery that FireEye had been targeted.  If that had been more successful, would we have been talking about the compromise of FireEye security devices instead?\r\n\r\nThe one clear thing that comes from all of this is that there is some critical software that runs our systems, from managing our Active Directory, managing the network, or synchronising emails to the cloud.  These are generally highly privileged and we still struggle to correctly limit such privileged software to ensure that it has permissions to do it\u2019s job, without having permissions to compromise the entire network.  We need to focus more on these backend services and the management, monitoring and enforcement of them.  It\u2019s not cool and interesting security work, but it should be high on our priority lists.",

This is likely because mobile devices are difficult to manage and secure, due to their personal nature, and bad actors are aware of this security gap.\r\nIn one study, 92% of FT 500 companies said they were worried that their growing mobile workforce represents a rising risk of security issues.

It is just that the number of possible ideas is so large that any particular idea is probably not going to work, even if it was chosen very carefully and intelligently. To make progress, you need to start with a bunch of bad ideas, discard the worst, and evolve the most promising ones. Apple, a paragon of visionary design, goes through dozens of prototypes before landing on a final product. The final product may be deceptively simple; it is the intricate knowledge of why this particular solution was chosen over its alternatives that allows it to be good.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge continues to be important even after the product is built. If a new team takes over the code for an unfamiliar piece of software, the software will soon start to degrade. Operating systems will update, business requirements will change, and security problems will be discovered that need to be fixed. Handling these subtle errors is often harder than building the software in the first place, since it requires intimate knowledge of the system\u2019s architecture and design principles.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, an unfamiliar development team can address these problems with stopgap fixes. Over time though, new bugs accumulate due to the makeshift nature of the additional code. User interfaces become confusing due to mismatched design paradigms, and system complexity increases as a whole.

We might worry about attackers getting into our servers or networks, but it doesn\u2019t matter how much encrypted fairy dust we apply to the data, once it reaches the end user device, it has to be decrypted to be shown to the user.\r\n\r\nYour whatsapp messages might be fully encrypted end to end, however the whatsapp application itself can always read the words that are in the messages.\r\n\r\nAny security around your corporate network has to cover the security of the end user devices, whether that be corporate laptops and desktops or personal mobile phones.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in the mass migration to working from home as a pandemic response, we also saw a laxening of the security controls around the end user devices.  Organisations didn\u2019t have enough laptops to provide everyone with one, and workforces who normally timeshared desktops would need to log in remotely from home.\r\n\r\nThe normal controls for this sort of thing might include using proxies to check what the device is accessing, or activity control on the device.  But these are increasingly privacy intruding and much harder to implement or justify if users are using the devices in their personal home and for personal business.\r\n\r\nFor many of us working from home, Covid has blurred the lines between work and personal time.  We tend to sit in the same seat, in the same room when we work and when we play computer games or browse the web.  This blurring of boundaries will inevitably lead to a relaxation of typical behaviours and provide security risks for the corporates.\r\n\r\nBut even if we can implement strong controls, such as VPN\u2019s, activity monitoring and device attestation, the move to storing data in SaaS services, and zero-trust principles don\u2019t make this easy to implement.  Even if your core network requires a healthy device and up to date patch status, you can\u2019t require Trello or other tools to implement that as well.  About the only way to do this right now is to implement some form of Identity Aware Proxy in front of these internet based systems, which defeats much of the point of using internet accessible tools.\r\n\r\nHow we get solve these problems is going to be a big focus in the coming years.  Supply chain compromises show us that we need to both take advantage of these new dynamic and easy to change systems, but we need to be able to understand the security implications and manage the access controls and risk that they provide.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another note, I want to thank people who wrote back to me with comments about the last few newsletters.

This is mistaken for two reasons. One is trivial: Q first gained an audience with a different set of drops, because their earliest efforts sank without a trace and weren\u2019t rediscovered by anyone on 4chan until November 11 that same year. The other is deeply significant: Q\u2019s origins can\u2019t be divorced from the culture of /pol/, which was a rich slurry of racism, anti-Semitism, and (especially relevant here) right-wing conspiracy theories.\r\n\r\nTherefore, QAnon was both an outgrowth and an evolution of /pol/ culture: not only were many of Q\u2019s claims already popular on /pol/, but Q borrowed key themes and ideas from predecessors. The key to understanding the roots of Q is to understand the culture of /pol/.\r\n\r\nBut first, we need to understand the myth.\r\n\r\nMeet the Mythos\r\nHere is the core of the QAnon myth: with the aid of a small group of military intelligence officers called the Q team (one or more of whom is supposedly responsible for writing the drops), President Donald Trump is waging a shadow war against a cabal of Satan-worshipping, child-eating pedophiles who are conspiring to obstruct and overthrow him. The military will arrest them en masse in an event called \u201cthe Storm.\u201d The cabal\u2019s membership has grown in the telling (at first, it was \u201cmany in our government;\u201d within a month, any \u201ccelebs\u201d who had \u201csupported HRC\u201d might very well be in on it; a few months later, there were too many to fit into Guantanamo Bay; later still, three other \u201cdetention centers [were] being prepped\u201d), but it would be fair to say that virtually anyone who\u2019s angered or defied President Trump is considered part of the cabal, along with the usual suspects like financier and philanthropist George Soros.\r\n\r\nAfter the Storm, military tribunals will ensure that these baby-eating traitors are executed or sentenced to life in prison. Faced with overwhelming proof of the cabal\u2019s existence, a stunned public will mourn; rage; and ultimately unite behind President Trump, ushering in a golden age of patriotism and prosperity.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, this description covers none of the most bizarre corners of QAnon (for instance, in QAnon lore, North Korea was controlled by the CIA but has now been liberated by Trump and the Q team). It also omits a key aspect of the QAnon worldview: that every public act or utterance of President Trump or a suspected cabal member might contain \u201ccomms,\u201d or secret messages, which QAnon believers can decode. And it leaves out one of the most important QAnon slogans: \u201cdisinformation is necessary,\u201d which some might call a wonderful excuse for Q\u2019s failed predictions, also allowing believers to pick and choose which parts of the theory they embrace.",

It has a rhythm and a powerful drip, drip, drip of dopamine, and as a manager you will never ever feel that. Sorry! Some people eventually make peace with this, but many never do. No shame in that.\r\n\r\nThis is partly a function of time and proximity. Manager successes and failures play out over a much longer period of time than the successes and failures of writing and debugging code, and you can only indirectly trace your impact.

For some us, our resolutions will already be broken, especially in the face of a continuing global pandemic and the sheer sense of apathy that everyone I speak to has.  \r\n\r\nIt's felt like quite a lot has been fit into a fairly short period of time, from attempted insurrection to mass platform bans, from global supply chain hacks to your everyday breaches.  Keeping our head, our sense of self, and our teams together in this time requires us to be clear communicators, and to take the time and effort to engage in positive leadership.\r\n\r\nI've been clear when setting out my teams objectives that we're not pulling in what would be traditional big hairy audacious goals, or OKR's that we're only moderately confident we can achieve.  Instead our team needs to set its sights lower, and work out what can be considered audacious and stretch goals given the context in which we work.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I've set myself goals to read more management books, to exercise more often, and to try to practice what I preach as much as I can.  By the end of the second week of January, I've read no management books, but I have managed to follow an exercise plan.  What I have been doing is turning my reading attention online to valuable sources that I think will help me as a senior manager, as an analyst, and to keep stretching and testing myself.  You'll probably see some of that in the articles that I select over the coming months, a few more articles about leadership and tech leadership in particular.  Of course, the constant tire fire that is cybersecurity means that there will of course be plenty of stories about breaches and ways to approach them, so don't worry that I'm changing focus of this newsletter.\r\n\r\nAs always, I welcome feedback and suggestions.  I read all the replies to this newsletter, even if I'm not great at replying back myself, and you can feel free to send me links, or just tag me on twitter.  I read, I reckon, at least 5 cybersecurity newsletters a week, another 50 RSS feeds and read around 50-80 stories that catch my attention and try to select 10 that I think are interesting.

You should therefore have hopefully enjoyed a long read about Solarwinds just before Christmas, and I hope you found it informative and more importantly, you didn't end up working over Christmas to mitigate any damage caused by the incident.  If you did, remember that you do need a break, and that you need to make sure to take that week off sometime soon.  Get some rest and take time to recover.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting things to come out of the Solarwinds experience is not just an awareness of the vulnerability of our systems to their supply chain (more about that in a few weeks), but an awareness of just how vulnerable our cloud instances are to attacks from our physical locations.  I've been arguing for a few years now that the cloud is in many ways more secure than your physical data center for the vast majority of threat models, but I hadn't considered the threat that is posed by the fact that we assume the physical data center to be a trusted center.  If your data center has direct connection to your cloud and is able to bypass all of the security guards, then your cloud isn't more secure, because it still has the weaknesses of the data center at it's heart.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft have released some good guidance on patterns and changes you might want to make, ensuring that there is appropriate separation between your on premise solutions and your cloud instances.\r\n\r\nBut just because our cloud instances are patched and well maintained it doesn't mean that there are no risks.  In fact there are all kinds of new risks with cloud services.  This edition there's a number of write ups about cloud specific attacks that can carried out.  We have to remember that when you are running in the cloud, there are accounts and configurations that are far easier to abuse.  Attacks that make use of the cloud infrastructure and configuration are not well documented or articulated at the moment, but some of the articles really do start to improve that.",

For example, the inserted malicious code is lightweight and only has the task of running a malware-added method in a parallel thread such that the DLL\u2019s normal operations are not altered or interrupted. This method is part of a class, which the attackers named OrionImprovementBusinessLayer to blend in with the rest of the code. The class contains all the backdoor capabilities, comprising 13 subclasses and 16 methods, with strings obfuscated to further hide malicious code.\r\n\r\nOnce loaded, the backdoor goes through an extensive list of checks to make sure it\u2019s running in an actual enterprise network and not on an analyst\u2019s machines. It then contacts a command-and-control (C2) server using a subdomain generated partly from information gathered from the affected device, which means a unique subdomain for each affected domain. This is another way the attackers try to evade detection.\r\n\r\nWith a lengthy list of functions and capabilities, this backdoor allows hands-on-keyboard attackers to perform a wide range of actions. As we\u2019ve seen in past human-operated attacks, once operating inside a network, adversaries can perform reconnaissance on the network, elevate privileges, and move laterally. Attackers progressively move across the network until they can achieve their goal, whether that\u2019s cyberespionage or financial gain.",

As our teams act as first responders to these attacks, these ongoing investigations reveal an attack that is remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact.\r\n\r\nThere are broader ramifications as well, which are even more disconcerting.

            "intro": "I\u00a0was going to have a nice relaxing holiday and take a few weeks off from writing a newsletter and news roundup!\r\n\r\nLast week I talked a bit about the FireEye breach, and was saying that the loss of the red team tools was not as big a deal as was being made out.  I had not realised (like many of us), how big a deal the attack mechanism would be.\r\n\r\n## So what\u2019s the big deal?\r\n\r\nLet's start with the basics shall we.  Solarwinds Orion is a network management tool.  You can install it on your network in order to see what is happening on the network, which devices are there, and use it to manage those devices, to patch them and maintain them.  It was discovered that someone had managed to install a backdoor into the software that could enable them to get into the networks of people running the software. [Fireeye call them UNC2452](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html), where UNC means \"Uncategorised\" meaning that FireEye are not confident that they can associate the activity with any known existing group.  \r\n\r\nThe change in the Solarwinds Orion software was introduced back in March 2020, which means that anyone who has patched since then will have installed the infected version.  Because this software is often installed to manage networks, it often has a lot of privileges, meaning that it's a really valuable target for such a compromise.\r\n\r\nThe impact of simply installing the backdoored software isn't necessarily that great.  The backdoor waits a few weeks to. avoid detection and then beacons out to a command and control servers hosted at a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com.  This would install a second piece of malware, codenamed SUNBURST, which would check your system out, beacon back and wait for instructions.  If the attacker decided you were interesting, then the malware would carry out further compromise, at which point the details get a little fuzzy as the attack seems to have different mechanisms for different targets, making correlating the known data hard.  For the vast majority of people infected, this SUNBURST infection is as far as it got.  Microsoft reports that around 17,000 people are known to have installed the known bad software, and that they are reaching out to around 40 who are known to have been infected further.  Those numbers will likely grow over time, that's just what we know so far.\r\n\r\nHowever, because these were highly capable actors, those who have been infected further are in for quite a time trying to uncover what the actor did with their access.  Those infected further should definitely be calling in experts in cyber remediation to help them coordinate the incident and ensure that any infection is removed.\r\n\r\nThis attack is a big deal for a number of reasons.  Firstly, this is a highly competent attacker who has struck at a critical chink in modern organisations infrastructure, their supply chain.  Secondly, the duration of infection, over 9 months, makes any detection and remediation really hard.  You need to retain all of your logs for nearly 300 days in order to still have them to hand, and the malware is very sneaky, so you'd need to keep and manage a lot of detail in order to investigate fully.  It's highly likely that some organisations will never truly know whether or not they were compromised, or that they've been able to work out what the attacker did inside their networks.  That will be a chilling thought for some partners and affected users.\r\n\r\n## Supply chain attacks\r\n\r\nSupply chain attacks are particularly nasty for organisations to defend against.  We have to have a complex supply chain, the sheer amount of companies involved in simply providing you with hardware, let alone the firmware, operating system, common utilities, network management and all the other basics that are needed to run a company in modern times.  It's almost impossible to avoid a complex, long and mostly opaque supply chain even in greenfield IT systems, and within a large organisation with decades of IT, your supply chain may well be unknown even within the organisation, let alone the list of suppliers and people that you consume software for.\r\n\r\n[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2347/)\r\n\r\nI'm sure that over the next month, you'll hear from all kinds of vendors, consultants and snake oil salespeople that their software can validate the supply chain, can detect the undetectable and would have prevented this attack.  But the sad reality is that this attack was almost undefendable against.  Strong geopolitical norms, agreement, policing and punishments would be needed to prevent supply chain attacks of this efficacy and magnitude, and none of those things will be achieved by a startup with \"dark\" or \"cyber\" in their name.\r\n\r\n## What can we do about these kinds of attacks?\r\n\r\nSo what can we do about these kinds of attacks?  What is it that we can do to defend ourselves and protect ourselves?  Is it even more compliance spreadsheets and questionnaires that we send to our suppliers?  Probably not, it's accepting that this is a risk that we must take in the modern world, and working out how we can limit the impact when it happens.  It means acknowledging that it is for governments, standards bodies and suppliers themselves to attempt to address the likelihood portion of this risk.\r\n\r\nWhat are the effective mechanisms for reducing the impact of the risk?  Well for starters, there was a lot of evasion techniques in the software.  If it thought that it would be detected, it would not run, it simply sat inert.  Deploying highly capable detection tools means that some malware wont run for fear of being detected, and it also means that the malware that does run is more likely to be detected.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we need to rethink our architectures for internet access.  Myself and Joel who sometimes contributes here have [talked in the past about terrible implementations of corporate man-in-the-middle internet proxies](https://medium.com/@joelgsamuel/can-we-stop-intercepting-user-traffic-aka-man-in-the-middle-please-2a00de208d4b), and the privacy and security impact that they have on your corporate IT.  But we're talking about the use of those proxies in your end user devices, of intercepting your staffs access to emails, doctors surgery websites, online shopping and banking.  Your data centers have far less reason to reach out to the internet willy-nilly.  Even within a cloud environment, the servers and services in that environment should ideally be put through a whitelisting proxy that only allows communication to known good endpoints.  \r\n\r\nThat's a much harder recommendation than it sounds however, as lots of software reaches out to wide, unreliably defined networks and domain names.  Much software does not come with any documentation on how it's updates work, what domains it should talk to, and often changes from patch to patch.  This adds to a workload for an IT team, to manage that white list, to handle systems that don't work because they don't have the internet access.  That cost will have to be borne by IT teams in order to manage a suitable protection.  It's worth noting that if you had such a whitelist in place, the malware wouldn't have executed.  \r\nOf course, in this case, it's highly likely that your IT team would have inspected the payload and content, determined it was a valid payload and whitelisted it.  Suppliers are going to need to start providing better lists of the domains and addresses that they use, and ensuring that they stick to it as well.  That change is going to take time, but will make attackers lives significantly harder.\r\n\r\nThe third thing is being able to determine what was done.  There's a few important detective capabilities that you'll need, but some of the key ones are DNS lookups and authentication logs.  I'm sure there are others that would be useful, but at its core, some of the strongest indicators come from the lookup of C2 systems, and the lateral movement of attackers through your network. \r\n\r\nFrom the NSA bulletin, we know that this particularly advanced actor is stealing core authentication keys, and using that to mint their own tokens for accessing systems.  It describes these keys as forgeries, which is accurate.  As a friend pointed out, if you stole a complete passport printing system, and all the details needed, those would still be forged passports, but they would be indistinguishable to real passports.  The key here is not being able to detect that user authentications are invalid because they are a poor copy of a real authentication attempt, but being able to detect that the authentication attempt did not correlate with all of the other processes that would occur.  This is like not trying to detect whether a passport was manufactured poorly, but one that was issued weirdly or used weirdly.\r\n\r\nIn an interview, FireEye suggested that one mechanism that helped them notice the breach was that a user enrolled a new MFA token, which triggered an automated alert to the security team and to the user, who confirmed that they hadn't attempted to enroll a new token.  This kind of contextual monitoring is hard to do, and may give you false positives, but is likely to pay dividends if you ever get targeted by an advanced actor, or even a low level actor using a tool you've not seen, because trying to get access to user credentials is one of the most valuable and common lateral steps that an attacker will take.\r\n\r\n\r\n## So what should you do about Solarwinds?\r\n\r\nFirstly, this is a big deal in high tech, NGO and government circles.  But only 40 out of 17,000 potential targets (so far) is still quite small.  Even if that number grows by an order of magnitude, it's likely that unless you think you would be targeted by a nation state group intent on espionage that you were a bystander in this case.  \r\n\r\nHowever, you should definitely follow the advice of someone like the NCSC, and check whether you use the software and look for indicators of compromise.  It's coming up to Christmas time, so you need to acknowledge that people have had a rough 2020 and prepare yourself for a marathon rather than a sprint in incident response. \r\n\r\nConcentrate on your corporate IT and your critical business assets.  Find out if they are actively exposed, running the version or have ever run the version and start looking for the indicators of compromise.  Even the minimum should give you some confidence about what is and isn't at risk, and enable you to prioritise efforts in the best places.  There has been good publication already of the major indicators of compromise, but this is a changing situation, so there will be more released over time.  Ensure that you have the logs that will be relevant, and if you think you\u2019ve been seriously compromised, then you should get a professional cyber incident response company in to help you.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you should reach out to your major critical suppliers. In particular, if you outsource the management of your servers or network to a supplier, you want to know whether their systems are vulnerable, as we have [evidence of high capability actors pivoting through managed service providers in the past](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html). You aren\u2019t asking whether that MSP runs Solarwinds for you on your network, but get a statement from them about whether they run it on their network that manages their systems, and what incident response they are doing.",

The attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye. They are highly trained in operational security and executed with discipline and focus. They operated clandestinely, using methods that counter security tools and forensic examination. They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past.\r\n\r\nWe are actively investigating in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other key partners, including Microsoft. Their initial analysis supports our conclusion that this was the work of a highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDuring our investigation to date, we have found that the attacker targeted and accessed certain Red Team assessment tools that we use to test our customers\u2019 security. These tools mimic the behavior of many cyber threat actors and enable FireEye to provide essential diagnostic security services to our customers. None of the tools contain zero-day exploits. Consistent with our goal to protect the community, we are proactively releasing methods and means to detect the use of our stolen Red Team tools.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are not sure if the attacker intends to use our Red Team tools or to publicly disclose them. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we have developed more than 300 countermeasures for our customers, and the community at large, to use in order to minimize the potential impact of the theft of these tools.\u00a0\u00a0",

The company was the first, for instance, to tie the hacker group known as Sandworm\u2014responsible for blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 as well as the hyperdestructive worm NotPetya the following year\u2014to Unit 74455 of Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. FireEye also provided the first public evidence that the same GRU unit was responsible for the attempted sabotage of the 2018 Winter Olympics. All of those attacks were later named in a US indictment of six Sandworm hackers unsealed in October.\r\n\r\nThe apparently retaliatory hack sends a clear statement that while Russia may have been relatively quiet during the US presidential election, the Kremlin\u2019s digital prowess remains formidable. At the same time, the fallout from the hack doesn\u2019t compare to the release of tools like the NSA\u2019s Eternal Blue tool, which a mysterious group called the Shadow Brokers leaked in 2017, or the breach of exploit broker Hacking Team in 2015.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe most important data that a company like FireEye has is data about its customers. The second most important data they have are the sources and methods they use to protect their customers,\u201d like threat intelligence data, says Richard Bejtlich, former chief security officer of Mandiant, the incident response division of FireEye, and principal security strategist at the network analysis firm Corelight. \u201cFarther down the line are the red team tools, where they\u2019re emulating adversaries.\u201d",

            "intro": "Remember that term \"assumed breached\", well if FireEye can get breached, then you should assume that pretty much anyone can.\r\n\r\nOf course there are companies that you simply have to trust in some ways, your core identity provider is one, generally most organisations trust AWS and Microsoft to not be fundamentally breached, but beyond that you need to start working out who you trust, and how much you trust them.\r\n\r\nSome of this is the heart of threat modelling, a subject that I keep meaning to write a blog about, but life just keeps getting in the way.  Threat modelling is generally very poorly practiced, and many organisations really struggle to apply threat models within projects, let alone at higher abstractions such as across their supply chain, within their organisation or across their industry generally.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the real \"big deal\" about the FireEye hack.  I've talked a bit below about why the loss of the red team tools isn't that big a deal, and how the loss of customer data would be a much bigger deal.  But the real impact here is the loss of credibility for cyber security generally.  Senior executives around the world, faced with increasing financial pressures, are going to look at this, and look at the requests for security spend and think \"If FireEye, a cyber security company, couldn't keep from being hacked, then why should I bother spending extra here?\"\r\n\r\nThe loss of credibility makes it even harder to justify even small amounts of security spend on small things, like central IDAM solutions that work and support 2FA, like using VLANS and VLAN ACLs to segment your network, like employing Endpoint Detection and Response software to your endpoints.\r\n\r\nWe know that these are tools and techniques that significantly raise the bar for attackers, and make it far more likely that the general unwashed masses of blackhat hackers, teenagers and hacking collectives will move on to another target when their scripts don't work as expected.  That doesn't mean that an advanced attacker can't get around them, but it does mean that more effort is required, which massively changes your threat model.\r\n\r\nWe need to reinforce that yes, attackers can and will compromise and breach any system, even cyber companies.  Our job is to make sure that they pay for that, in effort expended, in monetary cost, and in disclosed equities such as novel tools or techniques that were needed to get to you.  We need to continue to argue with businesses that we shouldn't just shrug and give in.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmin note:  This is the last newsletter of 2020.

That's important to note and is true that they are focused on entirely different threat models and achieve different security properties.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about the \"rise of the single user operating system\".  While you can consider an iOS device to be single user at any given time, there are numerous games and applications on my family ipad that don't cope with the fact that it's a shared device that many people use in the house.

The most extreme example of this is iOS\u2014more than a billion active devices\u2014which does not even support multiple user accounts on a single device. But even more traditional desktops and laptops have typically only one logged-in user. Rarer devices that support fast user switching can be configured so the VPN disconnects as one user and connects as another on a switch. The large shared Unix minicomputers with terminals are now interesting hobby projects, not typical corporate setups.\r\n\r\nThe second change is the near-universal virtualization of servers with virtual machines or container technology such as Linux namespaces. There are several forces driving this change and several ways it is achieved, but the result is the same: A server ends up running on a multiuser, multitasking Unix operating system with effectively a single-purpose process and one user.\r\n\r\nIn both of these cases, the result is that the operating system's virtual tunnel IP addresses now line up with service identities used for authorization. On end-user devices an IP address is a user, and in data centers each service instance has its own IP. With WireGuard ensuring every packet with a particular IP source is cryptographically linked to a verifiable identity, we can start safely making statements such as, \"Address a is user u,\" which simplifies software development.",

This information is obtained through calls to a microservice vending the membership information, retrieval of configuration information from DynamoDB, and continuous processing of messages from other Kinesis front-end servers. For the latter communication, each front-end server creates operating system threads for each of the other servers in the front-end fleet. Upon any addition of capacity, the servers that are already operating members of the fleet will learn of new servers joining and establish the appropriate threads. It takes up to an hour for any existing front-end fleet member to learn of new participants.\r\n\r\nAt 5:15 AM PST, the first alarms began firing for errors on putting and getting Kinesis records. Teams engaged and began reviewing logs. While the new capacity was a suspect, there were a number of errors that were unrelated to the new capacity and would likely persist even if the capacity were to be removed. Still, as a precaution, we began removing the new capacity while researching the other errors. \r\n\r\nAt 9:39 AM PST, we were able to confirm a root cause, and it turned out this wasn\u2019t driven by memory pressure. Rather, the new capacity had caused all of the servers in the fleet to exceed the maximum number of threads allowed by an operating system configuration. As this limit was being exceeded, cache construction was failing to complete and front-end servers were ending up with useless shard-maps that left them unable to route requests to back-end clusters. We didn\u2019t want to increase the operating system limit without further testing, and as we had just completed the removal of the additional capacity that triggered the event, we determined that the thread count would no longer exceed the operating system limit and proceeded with the restart.",

Of course there's some awareness of what other organisations in your sector are doing, ensuring that you are aren't focused on the wrong things, but the majority of strategy is about ensuring that the feedback looks are complete, and that your teams can execute on what they should be doing, because 9 times out of 10, your people on the ground already know what they should be doing!  The strategy is about making it easy, adopting what has gone before and making it faster, easier and better.",

Security people cover physical threats, cyber threats as well as information risks and often data protection concerns as well.\r\n\r\nWe tend to get a little focused on our speciality, and see everything through the one lense.  For myself, that means focusing on the security of digital services and end user devices, and forgetting the physical, personnel and process security areas that are just as important.\r\n\r\nBut even within our areas, we can over-focus on certain aspects of security.  If you are a developer heavy shop, you tend to worry about how your developers write code, how you test it for security issues, and where and how it's deployed.  But if you are running your own code, you probably have a platform of infrastructure that needs managing and securing as well.\r\n\r\nThe statistics from DataDog indicates that large numbers of people deploy Kubernetes and then take a long time to upgrade it.  That's understandable, it's a major and complicated infrastructure system with lots of moving parts and while CNCF have done a lot to make it easier to upgrade, organisations are used to performing major infrastructure updates on an annual basis at best.\r\n\r\nBut the rate of change in these platform providers is hugely faster than it was in the non-cloud-native generation of platforms.  CNCF releases Kubernetes updates once a quarter, and AWS releases new features and changes so often I can barely keep up with the announcements.\r\n\r\nBut a security bug in your platform can mean that a single, unimportant and unmaintained application on your platform can become a risk to the entire platform and to all of the other applications on your platform.\r\n\r\nAs well as concerning yourself with the software development and deployment of your applications, you need to focus on the methods and mechanisms for managing and deploying the infrastructure itself.  You need to ensure that the configuration is tested, is auditable, and is easy to change and deploy.  Only through deploying regular changes to the infrastructure will you be able to patch fast enough to keep up with the changes going on.  And if you think upgrading Kubernetes once a quarter is hard, try doing it after 2 years with 8 versions of releases to apply to your cluster!",

Resource-based policies usually include a Principal field that specifies the identities (users or roles) allowed to access the resource. If the policy contains a nonexistent identity, the API call that creates or updates the policy will fail with an error message. This convenient feature, however, can be abused to check whether an identity exists in an AWS account. Adversaries can repeatedly invoke these APIs with different principals to enumerate the users and roles in a targeted account. Furthermore, the targeted account can\u2019t observe the enumeration because the API logs and error messages only appear in the attacker\u2019s account where the resource policies are manipulated. The \u201cstealthy\u201d property of the technique makes detection and prevention difficult.

It is better to equip people with the right tools and skills rather than enforcing documented rules and policing compliance. And so, when crisis hits and instinct takes over, the instinct reinforces the \u2018right\u2019 behaviours of understanding users and their needs, respecting security, prioritising accessibility and being committed to measuring, learning and iterating over time.\r\nThis culture needs to be a public sector culture, not something advocated by a particular pocket of a particular organisation. Effective services can only be built by diverse, multi-disciplinary teams that default to involving the public (even if face to face contact is difficult) as they try to understand whole problems and design end to end experiences. These teams will naturally work across organisational boundaries to ensure that users avoid dead ends after being handed from one organisation to another. They will also be mindful of both public facing and internal processes to avoid the \u2018swivel-chair integration\u2019 of websites feeding paper based internal processes that require the presence of on-site staff.",

With these challenges effectively commoditised, you can focus your time and resources on solving business problems that are unique to your organisation, rather than constantly having to reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\nFinally, when selecting a cloud service, make sure that it meets your needs and helps you to secure your data.

Firstly the supporting team has to manage those requests, it has to have a mechanism for the requests coming in and it has to advertise that capability across the organisations.  But it creates a burden on the delivery team as well, they might have to fill in 4 different forms from 4 different supporting teams, all of which ask for very similar information.  \r\n\r\nSelf service capabilities assume that teams are able to request the thing they need, and can get access to it simply and trivially.  \r\n\r\nWhen a central support team really provides easy central self service tools and platforms, it encourages adopts, but it also \"paves the path\", making it the easiest and most supported way for a delivery team to get something done.  That means that you can focus your engineering investment on that core supported products and every team that uses the self service system will gain the rewards.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you've not done this for the last 10 years, there is going to be hundreds of systems that are not unified, and you will need to educate the users on how to select the right tool, but it's a start, and if you can improve the flow of the delivery teams, you can concentrate your effort on the migrating the more complex cases over time.",

I'm not entirely convinced that [the research](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/publications/Tan-CCS20.pdf) matches exactly what is being outlined here, so lets break this into two parts.\r\n\r\nFirst the good news.  They find that \r\n\r\n> how users pick passwords has changed over time, and that this, in combination with advances in password guessing, implies that requiring passwords to have multiple character classes brings at best minor benefit to password strength\".  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, they find that users who are asked to remember passwords with complexity rules find it harder to do so than those who simply have to remember long passwords.  Additionally, they found that blocklists, while effective, when implemented alone, can cause users to swap a strong but blocked password for a much weaker, but not blocked password.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting finding is this bit...\r\n\r\n> But while minimum-strength policies can be strengthened against offline attacks by either increasing the minimum required length or the minimum number of character classes, increasing the minimum length accomplishes this at a lower usability cost, in terms of how long users need to create a compliant password and how annoying or challenging they find that task.\r\n\r\nNow the bad news... \r\n\r\nThe neural network password meter caused users to voluntarily seem to select passwords with more classes than without it.  That is to say, when users see a \"strength meter\", they start choosing to add symbols and numbers and things to their passwords anyway.  They also note that over time (since their 2016 study), users have started creating more complex passwords anyway, potentially because they've been trained by all these websites with complexity requirements. (People's passwords have also gotten longer in the last 4 years too).  I'm not sure that relying on users selecting more classes is good for password complexity.  Their study is clear that longer passwords are by far the hardest to crack, and that the best action to improve security is to add more characters or words to the password.  The variety or password complexity in here is inherant rather than explicit, and I'm not comfortable with that.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Neural Network tool is not well explained.  It's unclear just how it works, and that lack of visibility worries me.  How do we know how it's picking hard passwords?  Because the neural network is inherently inexplicable, this creates a user experience problem where users might be told that their chosen password is weak, but unable to be told how to make things better.",

This new perspective led the researchers to discover a threshold between password strength and length\u2014one that causes users to create passwords that are both stronger and more usable than they would under common password policies.\r\n\r\nTo reach this discovery, the researchers conducted online experiments, evaluating combinations of minimum-length requirements, character-class requirements, minimum-strength requirements, and password blocklists\u2014lists of words that shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be used in passwords due to their common use.\r\n\r\nIn the online experiments, study participants were asked to create and recall passwords under randomly assigned password policies. First, participants assumed the role of someone whose email provider had been breached and needed to create a new password according to their assigned policy. Then, a few days later, they were asked to recall their password as a way to measure the usability of the password policy.\r\n\r\n... a minimum strength and a minimum length of 12 characters achieved a good balance between security and usability.Nicolas Christin, Associate Professor, EPP and ISR\r\n\u201cWe found that a policy requiring both a minimum strength and a minimum length of 12 characters achieved a good balance between security and usability,\u201d says Nicolas Christin, a professor in ISR and EPP.\r\n\r\nAlthough blocklist and minimum-strength policies can produce similar results, minimum-strength policies are flexibly configured to a desired security level, and they are easier to deploy alongside real-time requirements feedback in high-security settings.",

Secondly, many of the people involved in security don't have software development experience, and so tools have tended to either be vendor driven, or dedicated to the sections of the community that does have software development experience (hackers mostly).\r\n\r\nBut over the last few years, the DevOps revolution has bought in lots of platform teams, product teams and has given the tangential security teams access to and awareness of the automated tooling that exists in those areas.  Security and \"SecOps\" is following, with security people demanding better and better tools, but also adding security features to the existing DevOps tools.\r\n\r\nThis growth means that there are more and more tools out there, many of them custom built to scratch the itch of a security engineer in one company, but the maturity of this market is moving and changing.  If you don't have security engineers in your security team, who are looking at these tools, evaluating them, and working with your operations and developer teams to implement them, then you are going to be left behind.",

While some vulnerabilities have specific additional mitigations below, the following mitigations generally apply:\r\n\r\n* Keep systems and products updated and patched as soon as possible after patches are released.2\r\n* Expect that data stolen or modified (including credentials, accounts, and software) before the device was patched will not be alleviated by patching, making password changes and reviews of accounts a good practice.\r\n* Disable external management capabilities and set up an out-of-band management network.3\r\n* Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge and disable them in device configurations.4\r\n* Isolate Internet-facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to reduce the exposure of the internal network.5\r\n* Enable robust logging of Internet-facing services and monitor the logs for signs of compromise.6",

We have redacted the personal information of unsuspecting victims.\r\n\r\nKargar said that the video that accompanied some of the emails was reminiscent of a video ostensibly created by an Iranian domestic group after a series of mysterious explosions in the country, and an attack on a nuclear plant. The group took credit for those explosions, which have been publicly attributed to Israel, although Israeli officials have denied the accusation. According to Kargar, the fake Proud Boys' video echoes that Iranian video because it has a similar goal of spreading disinformation",

[And once I've read and digested properly, that'll be the focus of an upcoming cyber weekly].\r\n\r\nWe, in technology, have a tendency to think that we are always the first people doing the things we are doing.  And we might be in our area, but in many cases we are treading worn paths that have already been trodden by others in other industries, and we're not very good at learning from them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we also have a tendency to focus fighting the battles in front of us, the battles that form part of a war that we may well have already lost.  I gave a talk this week about security and technology and used the [Maginot line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line) as an example of this.  France built the Maginot line because it was trying to prevent a repeat of World War 1, where infantry advanced slowly and trench warfare was endemic.  The fortresses that formed part of the Maginot line were amazing fortresses and would have been indestructable to an oncoming force in 1939, had the Germans not invested in mechanised transport, light tanks and fast moving units, who were able to simply go around the defensive line.  The french had focused on winning the last war, whereas the Germans had focused on fighting the next one.  \r\n\r\nThose who don't know history are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, but those who don't lift their eyes from ground will never see what's coming over the horizon.",

The Good Judgment Project demonstrated that as little as one hour of training improved forecasting accuracy by about 14% over the course of a year.\r\nLearn the basics.\r\nBasic reasoning errors (such as believing that a coin that has landed heads three times in a row is likelier to land tails on the next flip) take a toll on prediction accuracy. So it\u2019s essential that companies lay a foundation of forecasting basics: The GJP\u2019s training in probability concepts such as regression to the mean and Bayesian revision (updating a probability estimate in light of new data), for example, boosted participants\u2019 accuracy measurably. Companies should also require that forecasts include a precise definition of what is to be predicted (say, the chance that a potential hire will meet her sales targets) and the time frame involved (one year, for example). The prediction itself must be expressed as a numeric probability so that it can be precisely scored for accuracy later.",

There the IAC members, with the DCI in the chair, gave it its final review, revision, and approval.\r\n\r\nAs is quite obvious from the sentence quoted above, Soviet and Satellite intentions with respect to Yugoslavia were a matter of grave concern in the high policy echelons of our government. The State Department's Policy Planning Staff was probably the most important group seized of the problem. Its chairman and members read NIE 29-51 with the sort of concentration intelligence producers can only hope their product will command.\r\n\r\nA few days after the estimate appeared, I was in informal conversation with the Policy Planning Staff's chairman. We spoke of Yugoslavia and the estimate. Suddenly he said, \"By the way, what did you people mean by the expression `serious possibility'? What kind of odds did you have in mind?\" I told him that my personal estimate was on the dark side, namely, that the odds were around 65 to 35 in favor of an attack. He was somewhat jolted by this; he and his colleagues had read \"serious possibility\" to mean odds very considerably lower. Understandably troubled by this want of communication, I began asking my own colleagues on the Board of National Estimates what odds they had had in mind when they agreed to that wording. It was another jolt to find that each Board member had had somewhat different odds in mind and the low man was thinking of about 20 to 80, the high of 80 to 20. The rest ranged in between.",

            "intro": "For those who don't know, I started a new job recently.  Leaving behind my contractor ways, I've returned to the civil service to help build security capabilities across government.  Part of that role includes setting up better situational awareness and horizon scanning for Government, a better ability to know what is happening both inside government and outside, in security and technology.\r\n\r\nOne of things that we are aiming to do is to start looking ahead at how the future looks and make predictions on what will happen.  Will people work from home, will there be more ransomware, will zero trust save us?\r\n\r\nBut humans are incredibly bad at predictions and more generally at probability.  You are far more likely to be injured crossing the street than you are flying in a plane, but yet people are petrified of flying and almost nobody is scared of crossing the road.  This is the result of collections of biases that makes it hard for us to accurately predict risks and dangers around us, and very difficult for us to foretell what is going to happen in the future.\r\n\r\nCase in point: https://m.xkcd.com/2370/\r\n\r\n It turns out that people are sucky forecasters, but that actually just a few fairly simple things can make us better at telling the future.  The first is being specific.  We love to dress up our predictions (as you'll have seen me do for the last 121 issues of CyberWeekly) in language that is vague.  \"Oh I think that X is likely\", or \"It's possible that Y might happen\".  This vague language tends to hold back our ability to both predict, because we can hide our own uncertainty in there, but also to work with others, because it's hard for us to tell what someone actually means by \"it's possible\", do they mean 10% of the time, or 40% of the time?\r\n\r\nWhile, as I point out below, Superforecasting has gotten a bad rep, mostly in my experience because of the sort of complete plonker who proudly declares that they are a super forecaster in their twitter bio, the research that Tetlock put in is pretty convincing.  When forecasting, people can be trained to get better at it through replicating some things that these so called superforecasters did intuitively.  Working out how to correctly compare data, analyse and make predictions is one part of the battle, but the biggest is keeping a record, and referring back to it, so that you can revisit and update your forecasts as you get more information.  This looking back at your forecasts with hindsight bias also helps you to learn how to make better forecasts.\r\n\r\nPredicting the future is hard, but that's what we often do in digital and security.  We are making bets that a given approach, system or thing will be better than the previous.  We are busy working out how to mitigate risks that may or may not happen, so shouldn't we learn to be more precise and accurate with our forecasts?",

Analyses of 64,000 dissertations found that titles produced by authors from lower-status schools included more jargon than titles from higher-status school authors. Experimental manipulations established that low status causally increases jargon use, even in live conversations. Statistical mediation and experimental-causal-chain analyses demonstrated that the low status\u00a0\u2192\u00a0jargon effect is driven by increased concern with audience evaluations over conversational clarity. Additional archival and experimental evidence found that acronyms and legalese serve a similar status-compensation function as other forms of jargon (e.g., complex language).

I\u2019d love to know which ones can be installed on mobile devices, which support multi-person video calls, which support group texts and so on.  You can use the N/A as a proxy for some of this.",

We can encourage people to become mastercraftsmen, truly mastering their craft and continuing to deliver;  We can encourage people to become coaches, working with other people to encourage, support and work with (without being burdened by the managerial meetings and oversight); We can encourage them to own a problem area, and become a manager within an area of the problem; or we can engage them as change vanguards.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to remember is that as an organisation, we need to value individual contributors with other rewards than simply promotion to management.  Extra pay, extra holidays, gifts and staff benefits, bonuses and support for learning and development.

We compound this by presenting only one career path for the \u201cdoers\u201d: management.

The answer of course, was that the face detection algorithm has a built in bias for light skin over dark skin, and prefers the white orb light in the background over the dark skinned faces in the foreground.\r\n\r\nIn that twitter thread, people noticed that the twitter picture zoom algorithm also happened to [choose to focus on the white participant as the main focus](https://twitter.com/colinmadland/status/1307115534383710208?s=20).  For large images, twitter needs to crop the image by default, and the attention algorithm tries to solve the problem of simple grabbing the center of the image (which had an unfortunate tendency to focus on women\u2019s chests), with a new algorithm that looks for faces and crop around them.\r\n\r\nThis might all seem funny at first, but as can be seen from the quoted tweet, we literally do build these algorithms into systems, and as those algorithms form building blocks for bigger algorithms, the bias built in will become more problematic in how and when it decides that people are relevant, interesting or useful.\r\n\r\nBias in algorithms is really hard to model for, because the real world, where we gather data from is already horribly biased.  Socioeconomic factors change life outcomes for people from a BAME background, pay can be visibly determined to be aligned to gender, and even when you attempt to correct for it, the reality is that thousands of tiny biases exist in our current data stores.  You can\u2019t take data on arrests, job equity, educational outcomes or pretty much anything, without having bias encoded in the data.  You would think that face detection, at least, would be easier to build and test for bias more easily than some of these grander and bigger data sets, but the use of this algorithm and training set in Twitter and Zoom means that it\u2019s highly likely that we cannot QA for bias in these systems very easily.",

But contexts vary, and therefore the use of obscurity might depend on the context as to whether it\u2019s any good or not.  If you chose not to implement TLS, you choose not to implement authentication, but you instead say that knowing the port is a sufficient protective control for a system, then you are getting a very low level of security in your system.  Pretty much any casual attacker will find your system and find you.  \r\n\r\nHowever, if you are running a covert red team operation, and you commission a third party, to purchase you some SIM cards so that they are not associated with you, then that\u2019s probably a reasonable and appropriate level of obscurity.  There are times where we need to obscure things for security reasons, for the entire point of obscuring a thing.  This is good obscurity.  When there are times where you know a system is vulnerable and instead of protecting it, you obscure it, then you are probably committing a sin against security through obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe interesting line here is that adding some obscurity to an already secure system may not be a bad thing.  If you have access to multiple cryptographic algorithms, which are well tested and well secured, then not telling all and sundry which algorithm is used isn\u2019t a bad thing.  Your attackers may find it hard to attack your algorithm knowing it\u2019s AES-128 in CBC model, but it\u2019s even harder if they first have to analyse the cipher text and try multiple algorithms as well as search the key space.",

            "intro": "[Apologies for missing last week.  I had some personal news that meant that my weekend was taken up with a lot of other stuff, and the newsletter dropped off my radar.]\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve moved to a distributed world, and many organisations have not had a unified strategic communications platform.  This starts to become an issues when you think about the ways that internal communications happen inside your organisation.\r\n\r\nOf course, the most important thing about your communications platform is that it should be usable, and it should enable your staff to communicate with one another in an appropriate way.  No matter what you do, you cannot prevent your staff from having personal phones, personal email accounts and using those to discuss work matters.  The best way to prevent that is for there to be a good set of communication tools that staff can use easily, and when they need it.\r\n\r\nDespite me mentioning unified comms above, this probably isn\u2019t a single platform.  Organisations that are doubling down on Microsoft Teams will be discovering that even where it\u2019s a great video product, it\u2019s a moderately awful text communication platform.  Staff more used to using Slack will miss the real time communication, divided into channels that seems to just flow in a way that Teams messages don\u2019t.  Staff who want to just send a simple message to a coworker will probably prefer to use SMS or WhatsApp from their phone than try to wrestle with an unfamiliar user interface.\r\n\r\nBut how secure should your communications system be?  We often want things to be perfectly secure, and we come up with gradings of all the ways that we think it should be secure, from end to end encryption to secure deletion.  But we fail to assess what we are using now, and note whether what we are moving towards has any security improvement over the existing system.  If your staff are using SMS to talk to each other now, then there is no encryption, data loss prevention, audit or protection in any form.  Using a tool that has even one of those will be an incremental improvement.

I don\u2019t use the statistics from these and I cannot find a way to turn these off.   I\u2019ll continue to publish this newsletter to CyberWeekly.net every week, where I don\u2019t put any Google analytics or link tracking of any form.  \r\n\r\nI had been looking around for alternatives anyway, but I cannot find any newsletter provider who won\u2019t wrap the links in tracking urls.  I did however look strongly at alternatives and I think that I\u2019d like to move this newsletter from TinyLetter to SubStack.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m planning on migrating this newsletter from TinyLetter to SubStack next week.  SubStack has a strong privacy statement, and is very popular for sending mailing lists at the moment.  It has a better ability for me to compose emails and easier collaboration tools.  It does still do link tracking, and I can\u2019t turn that off either.  You can read their [privacy policy](https://substack.com/privacy) and if you don\u2019t want your email address to be transferred to SubStack, then you can unsubscribe ahead of next weekend.  I\u2019ll import the mailing list next Saturday of all the people actively subscribed to TinyLetter and send next weeks newsletter out using the SubStack system instead.\r\n\r\nObviously, I should add, I don\u2019t use your data for anything other than sending these emails.  I will never sell or give away the email list or use it for any other purpose than the sending of CyberWeekly each week.",

An angry man went into a Target outside of Minneapolis, demanding to talk to a manager:\r\n\r\n\r\nTarget knows before it shows.\r\n\u201cMy daughter got this in the mail!\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s still in high school, and you\u2019re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe manager didn\u2019t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man\u2019s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.\r\n\r\n(Nice customer service, Target.)\r\n\r\nOn the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. \u201cI had a talk with my daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out there\u2019s been some activities in my house I haven\u2019t been completely aware of. She\u2019s due in August. I owe you an apology.\u201d\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We\u2019d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We\u2019d put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it looked like all the products were chosen by chance.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn\u2019t been spied on, she\u2019ll use the coupons. She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. As long as we don\u2019t spook her, it works.\u201d",

Availability over consistency reminds us that more often end users value the availability of the system over strong data consistency, and they\u2019re okay with eventual consistency.\u00a0\r\nLoose-coupling remains an important design concern in the case of microservices, with respect to afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) coupling.

            "intro": "When I see people talking about threat modelling, they can be referring to two totally different kinds of activities.\r\n\r\nComponent based threat modelling tends to look at an individual system and how the components interact.  The Microsoft threat modelling tool will allow you to do this, drawing up your system architecture and tracking risks and threats across the system.  Tools like the Escalation of Privilege can help you develop the skills to learn this style of threat modelling.\r\n\r\nBut I'm also a big fan of Systemic threat modelling, which is looking at the system as a black box, and often at how the attackers might look at your system.  Methods for analysing systems in this way vary and are far less common.  It's hard to find good tools and systems to help people consider how an attacker might actually operate.  We can use things like the Mitre ATT&CK system to build a shared vocabulary, but actual methods for threat modelling are less well described.\r\n\r\nA lot of my problem with much cybersecurity advice is that it often lacks a sensible or articulated threat model.  It's unclear what a given security control is actually trying to achieve and who it's protecting against.  The threats, as raised by Microsoft again this week, reminds us that account takeover through poor password hygiene and password stuffing is still the preferred attack of even the most competent adversary.  You can worry about side channel attacks and cache misses and quantum supremacy if you want, but the reality of attackers is that they want the simplest, easiest, safest mechanism to get to their target.",

These make headlines because the accusations of treason, of betraying your country and the damage caused is so significant that it washes out almost everything else.  But as I've referenced before, [a 2013 study of insider cases](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/system/files/documents/63/29/insider-data-collection-study-report-of-main-findings.pdf) showed that 76% were self initiated, and 47% were done for money.\r\n\r\nBut moles and humans aren't the only insider.  Anything and anyone that we trust has the possibility of being an insider.  The attacks below on AWS and GCE are both a form of \"Confused Deputy\" problem, which is to say, an internal tool that is allowed to conduct a privileged action doing so for the wrong user or program.  This form of attack is an insider attack on your system or network, because it looks like someone inside your network using their credentials correctly, but they've been tricked by another agent or actor.\r\n\r\nDealing with insiders is incredibly difficult, both the human version and the confused deputy problem.  Generally the argument is that compartmentalisation, minimal access, and need to know models work to make it much harder for an insider to act.  Anything that means that the insider has only very limited access to the information and systems that they need to use means that they cannot abuse their power as easily.  It's far easier to detect someone acting outside their role as anomalous behaviour, and to report on it.\r\n\r\nBut equally, that makes our systems less flexible, less agile and less efficient.  If some people don't know bits of information, they may not be able to do their jobs as effectively, and of course, you cannot have a holistic view of the system when information is too tightly compartmentalised.\r\n\r\nWe need to recognise that insider threats are a risk like many others, one that we should aim to quantify, and determine if the cost of reducing that risk outweighs the impact of the risk being realised.  Most insider threats are extremely rare, and despite having the greatest, most terrifying potential for damage, the damage when it happens is often much less than the potential damage.",

For example, if you prompt the model with an example of React code, and then tell it to generate more React code, you\u2019ll get much better results than if you gave it the simple prompt.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there are two high-level use cases for GPT-2: the creative use case for fun text generation at high temperature, as GPT-2 once was, and the functional use case, for specific NLP-based use cases such as webpage mockups, with a temperature of 0.0.\r\n\r\nGPT-3 was trained on a massive amount of text from all over the internet as of October 2019 (e.g. it does not know about COVID-19), and therefore it has likely seen every type of text possible, from code, to movie scripts, to tweets.

            "intro": "AI, Blockchain, Quantum Computing.  These are technologies that are \"set to revolutionise the world\", and yet, half the time I don't feel like the world is very revolutionary.\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time looking at future looking technology and trying to work out how it can apply, or should apply in our working lives.  How can we take advantage of it, and also importantly, how do we not get caught up in hype for exciting technology and miss fundamental but boring technology changes.  But the most important part of this is looking at what the social impact of this technology has for us.  At trying to determine if it makes a difference.\r\n\r\nWilliam Gibson once said that [\"The future is here - it's just not evenly distributed\"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/681-the-future-is-already-here-it-s-just-not-evenly), and our advances into the future of technology does feel like that on a regular basis.  I can pay for almost anything with my watch, hop in a car that can park itself, work 8 hours from home with a webcam and microphone, and ask an AI system to write me SQL queries but yet many problems still seem to be the same today as they were 10 years ago.\r\n \r\nMy old manager at a previous job always used to tell me that \"It's never a technology problem, it's always a people problem you've got to solve\".  It didn't matter how technical the ask was of the development team, behind that request was always a people and process problem.  People love to see new technology as solving what they perceive to be the problems in their lives.  But most of the problems in our life come out of far more fundamental problems in how we engage with other people, how we coordinate work and how we trust or don't trust them.  \r\n\r\nI see this manifest in the way that many security people struggle to understand why their users don't take their advice.  In their heads, their security advice is good advice, but the users are not to be trusted and just fail to follow the advice.  When security issues inevitably happen, the takeaway that these professionals have is \"if only they had listened to me and followed my process\".  For some reason, we have a blind spot about how well people can follow our processes.  We tend to think that if someone isn't following the path that we laid down, then that's because we haven't forced them hard enough to follow our path.\r\n\r\n[![Desire Path Closed - A photo of a worn path over grass, with a sign saying sidewalk closed on it](https://preview.redd.it/nin7l07bwfj11.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f50917a376050fe9be2ab46c722838ab8f4d4886)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesirePath/comments/9bu3wt/college_trying_to_block_our_desire_paths_but/)\r\n\r\nThe path that people want to follow is a clear indication of how they actually move around.  In user experience and interface design, we tend to call these \"desire paths\", and they come from the study of physical architecture.  People tend to want to go from A to B in the most obvious route possible.  You can put fences and bushes and things in the way, but all that does is irritate the pedestrians, and they tend to forge their own paths instead.  It's better to identify where people are going to go, and make that safe and paved instead of laying out what we think is the correct path.\r\n\r\nI've seen the same behaviour from security people as I've seen from project managers in the past.  The exclamations of \"The project would have been successful if only we'd gotten the requirements right\", or \"The predictions should have been correct, but our staff lie about how productive they are\" and so on.\r\n\r\nAs technologists and security specialists, we need to understand that our processes and tools fail when they meet users, not because we didn't nail down the processes and people well enough, but because we need to have a better understanding that underneath it all, there's a set of individuals, people, who have needs and desires.  We need to acknowledge those, build our tools and processes around improving the experience of people where they are, and make sure that we are paving the paths that users want to follow, not where we think they should go.",

To do so, it used Apple\u2019s own imagery against it, mimicking Apple\u2019s iconic \u201c1984\u201d ad from its own fight against IBM 36 years ago.

Doubtful.\r\n\r\nWill people continue to work from home or at least not want to commute back to the office?  Much harder to predict.\r\n\r\nVarious surveys have been done, and it seems likely that lots of office workers and their bosses see this kind fo work continuing.  But there's also a huge number of social shifts that also need to happen to support a change in work ethos across the country.  From what shops are open and when, to the effect it will have on house prices, the ramifications of a work from home generational shift is massive.\r\n\r\nBut looking at the competing hypothesis, there must be a large number of people who are working from a 1 room bedsit, sat on teh end of their bed, from shared houses with barely enough room to swing a cat, and from family homes where multiple generations are fighting over access to the computer, to broadband and to rooms to themselves to carry out their endless video conferences.\r\n\r\nIt's not so clear cut that all organisations will go 100% remote, but if not that, what?\r\n\r\nI think there's a far greater chance of organisations moving from a hub model, with big offices in expensive cities, to a far more distributed model.  Staff who work 2,3 or 4 days a week from a local WeWork or Regus shared office.  A place where they can sit comfortably and have social conversations.  These will bloom up all over the country, at a variety of costs, and organisations are going to have to think long and carefully about what the implications are.\r\n\r\nAfterall, you trust people in your office, even a shared office.  Every single time I've been to a WeWork for work, someone has asked me to \"watch their laptop\" while they go get a coffee or nip to the toilet.  They don't know me, they don't know that I'm fundamentally a good person.  How do we have a conversation about sensitive financial information, or one-on-ones with our bosses while working in these environments?\r\n\r\nLuckily, there are tech companies who have been working remote for some time.  The rise of Zero Trust computing is driven by some of this, the fact that you no longer have a corporate network requires new thinking.  The ways that we work are going to change, and we are going to need to predict those changes, and ensure that our staff can work safely and securely.",

But in assuming sole control of the number two spot in our rankings, Python is the first non-Java or JavaScript language ever to place in the top two of these rankings by itself, and would not have been the obvious choice for that distinction in years past. Underrated and often overlooked, the versatility of the language remains both its calling card and the basis for its continued strength. Much like Perl in its heyday, Python is the glue for thousands of small projects and the basis for countless personal scripts, including a few that retrieve data for these rankings. But it continues to find its footing amongst emerging and expanding categories, whether that\u2019s data science a few years ago or GPT-3 work today.

Don't let a tool define your process.\r\n\r\nTools act as a strong guiding mechanism for enforcing processes and standards on your teams.  If you want your teams to work a certain way, configuring JIRA to that standard will strongly encourage teams to work that way.\r\n\r\nA [tweet this week](https://twitter.com/bruntonspall/status/1291764924759322626?s=20) by [Mark Delgarno, one of the smartest thinkers about agile I know](https://medium.com/@markdalgarno), talked about the overuse of standards to lock down and prevent healthy experimentation.  I see this reflected in this article.  If you use Jira to set a software development methodology standard, you are making it hard for teams to experiment with their development process.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's only really experimentation (in the scientific sense), if you have a hypothesis, measure the results and control for changes to see if they make a difference.  Too many agile teams I see are endless tweakers to their process without any guiding force other than the cult of personality.  Allowing every team to simply decide their own rules isn't experimentation, it's enabling chaos that is difficult to track, difficult to determine if it's successful and makes mini-silos in your organisation that it's hard for people to move from one to another.\r\n\r\nBut at the root of it all, is the problem that JIRA is simply a tool, and you need more thinking about how you work than the tool you use.  Decide how you want to work, how you want to measure progress and how you will coordinate between teams, and then pick a tool that works for that process.",

They are a company that claims on their security page to be in \"Active participation in CyberSecurity thought leadership\", and loftily announces that all staff participate in regular phishing tests, they have a red team, and they have more or less every certificate in existence.\r\n\r\nOf course, they blame the hyper advanced hackers who have targeted them in this case, and talk about the ever changing threat landscape.

The data around the mapping of locations in things like Strava and Garmin has had numerous incidents over the last few years.

In order to successfully carry out ransomware you need 3 main things:\r\n\r\n1. The ransomware itself, an encryptor that encrypts the files and provides a decryption path\r\n2. The dropper, some malware that can execute on a machine, elevate it's privileges and then drop the ransomware\r\n3. A vulnerability that can get the dropper onto a machine\r\n\r\nIt used to be that ransomware and droppers were advanced stuff, but the rise of ransomware as a service means that enterprising developers with at least moderate amounts of skill can make a pretty penny just by building and selling the ransomware and the droppers themselves.  Given the availability of commercial pen testing and red team frameworks that include most of the hard work in this, the bar in this area just keeps getting lowered.\r\n\r\nThe third one sounds much harder than it actually is.  Given the patch cycles and capabilities of most organisations, you can simply scan, using freely available tools, and find hosts and systems that you want to affect, and you'll get a hit rate.  The more advanced attackers can use more up to date vulnerabilities, can watch exploit-db or exploitation frameworks and scan faster and better, but in reality, there's just so much of the internet to scan, there's plenty of room for all the adversaries out there.\r\n\r\nThat means that the capability level of ransomware attackers is mostly unknown when you get hit.  You don't know if they simply followed a script, and don't know what they are doing, or if they had access and the ability to do far more nefarious things on your network. \r\n\r\nThis brings us round to the point around whether paying for ransoms is a good idea.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I tend to be opposed to the idea of paying ransoms. \r\n\r\nThere are situations where paying the ransom to get your system back up and running is quicker, cheaper and better than rebuilding.  If it's a choice between paying the ransom and going bankrupt, you may not feel like you have much choice.\r\n\r\nBut in other situations, I don't see how once you've paid the ransom, how you can possibly ever trust the IT system again.  The attackers had to have access to the systems in order to encrypt them, and you don't know what changes they made, you don't know how many little back doors and helpers they left themselves.  They may have copied your data, or sold access to your systems to other criminals, or even just told their hacker friends!  Even if you get your system back up and running, you should assume that they know your network layout, they know all your passwords, and they can get back in.  If you rebuild from scratch in that case, which is the only way I can see you trusting it again, I don't see what paying the ransom really gave you.",

As part of the same ruling, the Court also decided that another data transfer mechanism, Standards Contractual Clauses, or SSCs, remain valid.\r\n\r\nAfter Safe Harbour\u2019s abrogation, US firms switched to a different, EU-approved template to transfer EU data to company servers in the US, known as standard contractual clauses, or SCCs. \u201cSCCs were the main route to transferring data once there were questions about the Safe Harbour regime,\u201d says Lorna Woods, a law professor at the University of Essex. Those SCCs, the ECJ has ruled, are still valid.\r\n\r\nA new data transfer agreement replacing Safe Harbour \u2013 called the EU-US Privacy Shield \u2013 was created in 2016 between the EU and US. The Privacy Shield restricts the US government from accessing EU citizens\u2019 data, adds provisions for EU citizens to refer complaints to a regulator and requires that companies who wish to transfer data to a third party must ensure that the third party also follows the Privacy Shield principals.\r\n\r\nAs Facebook and other companies began using SCCs to transfer data to the US, Schrems submitted a new complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, this time challenging Facebook\u2019s use of SCCs to transfer data. Once again, it was referred to the Irish High Court and then up to the ECJ. While the Privacy Shield wasn\u2019t part of Schrems\u2019 initial complaint, the Irish Court\u2019s request pulled the Privacy Shield into the case as well.",

            "intro": "There\u2019s a big new vulnerability and you should either be really scared, or a little scared depending which articles you read.\r\n\r\nYou can read more below, and my advice is that you should be making sure that you have patched your internal DNS servers if they are running Windows.  Actually scratch that, you should be keeping your internal DNS servers and other network service devices patched all the time regardless!\r\n\r\nBut what does it mean that this is an RCE or Wormable vulnerability?\r\n\r\nIn essence, your DNS servers sit on your network and listen for incoming traffic from other locations on the network.  If you are running your own external DNS servers (don\u2019t do this!), you might have separated the external facing ones from the internal ones, \u201cfor security\u201d.  \r\n\r\nThe Remote Code Execution means that anybody who can talk to the server can execute code, as if they were in control of the software.  Since this is system software, it means that in most cases, they have complete control of the computer, without needing usernames, passwords or anything more complex.  \r\n\r\nBut worse, this one is wormable, because just the same way that a worm burrows underground, our networks are often interconnected, and the things that interconnect them are often the networking infrastructure such as DNS servers.  So if you\u2019ve got external DNS servers, there\u2019s a very good possibility that they are allowed to talk DNS to internal DNS servers.  So a remote user can target and take over your external servers, and then burrow through them and your network and take over your internal DNS servers.\r\n\r\nEven worse, if you have multiple networks, multiple sites, or you have a managed service provider who runs your DNS servers for you, there\u2019s a very very strong possibility that this exploit could be used to burrow from site to site, over VPNs, between Managed Service Provider\u2019s tenant and so on.\r\n\r\nWormable exploits are some of the scariest, and of course, the [Morris Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm) was one of the first major internet outages, back in 1981, with a similar vulnerability but that time through the mail transmission agent, SendMail.  The thing that made that worse was that Robert Morris Jr wrote code that when it infected a machine, scanned for more machines to infect and replicated itself to target them.  It was this replication that actually caused the crash and the majority of the damage on the internet at the time.\r\n\r\nWannacry was of course, the most recent wormable exploit, using the BlueKeep vulnerability to spread around networks.  We were only partially affected because it had a built in killswitch which when triggered made it inert.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think this will be anywhere nearly as bad, because the number of Windows DNS servers on networks is low as a proportion of systems.  Many corporations run them on their internal networks, but the interconnectedness isn\u2019t there the way that mail servers were, and Wannacry exploited SMB which was enabled on many network servers.  So this likely won\u2019t be quite as serious, but anytime we hear about a vulnerability like this, it\u2019s one that we should take seriously.\r\n\r\nSo make sure you\u2019ve applied the patches or work arounds, and ensure your networks are appropriately segregated to prevent DNS traffic that isn\u2019t intended to cross network boundaries.",

In this case, pretty widely reported is that Twitters internal support application was accessible from the internet, and that it's suspected that the hackers were able to get access to the company slack instance, and from there found some credentials in the support channel that got them into the support application.\r\n\r\nNow you might be facepalming, but in reality, this is how lots of support systems run.  If your tools are easily integrated into your company identity system (and none of them ever are), then chances are that support users have shared accounts, post the username and passwords into whatever shared channels they have, and as such, access logs are a mess because the accounts are shared.  This is pretty common practice.  The only odd thing about this all is that I'd have expected that Twitters support tool would have needed either a VPN connection or 2FA (one or the other).",

Of course, post incident, the key question to ask ourselves is not \"how did this happen\" but \"how does this not always happen?\".\r\n\r\nI suspect the reality of this situation is that a small set of reasonably amateur hackers were able to get access to the twitter tools, and from there set about trying to flip certain high value accounts ownership.  Of course, since these are high value accounts, the original owner is going to kick up a fuss, and that's going to get noticed, but if you are taking old accounts or accounts that the user cannot seem to prove that there was an issue, then nobody would notice.  What happened here is that the attackers got greedy and that got them noticed.\r\n\r\nIn the writeups you see that there are slightly conflicting statements about who was behind this.  I suspect that there have been many of these groups with access to the support tools for some time, quietly using them to trade twitter accounts and not doing it to anyone high profile enough to get caught so far.  \r\n\r\nIt's easy to take this and run screaming, declaring that this is the problem with cloud providers for SaaS products, that there's a lot of admin staff who you cant trust, and that's still a fair statement.  But let's make sure that when you think about it, you are comparing apples to apples.  Your own admin systems and staff are likely no better, and probably worse than twitters are.  There might be fewer of them and they might be a smaller target, but most of the time when we think about this, we compare the support administrators of the cloud SaaS system to a mythical perfect team within our own organisation, rather than the reality of underpaid, overworked people who really work for us.",

On the other hand, Google implements OIDC provider and integrates it tightly with GKE through Workload Identity feature.

            "intro": "Why do we use the cloud?\r\n\r\nI mean, generally speaking, if you are lifting and shifting computers from your data center to a cloud service on a one-for-one basis, the major cloud providers are probably more expensive (depending how you measure your ops teams time), so it shouldn't be a cost saving purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are a few major reasons to use cloud services for your infrasture.\r\n\r\nThe first is speed and flexibility.  The ability to flex your infrastructure, to buy new machines, build new networks and move things around as fast as you can write code to make it happen (or click buttons in a UI if you are a monster).  That flexibility is a business advantage in outmanoeuvring your competition, as well as going to save your bacon when there are issues or unexpected surges that you can simply flex your way through.\r\n\r\nThe second is based on the advantages of being on a shared platform, and the security benefits that you get from that.  All of the major hyperscale provides have patched underlying Xen, VM or hardware bugs before most customers were even aware that they were a thing.  If you were on Google Compute, you probably didn't even care that Spectre or Meltdown were a thing, you were protected.\r\n\r\nBut as well as that, the platform providers are constantly seeing the traffic and behaviours of the systems they run for you, at scale.  That means they get a better idea of what normal looks like, and what abnormal is.  They are far more likely to see criminal or malicious activity at scale, the sort of untargeted attacks that affect all of us, and be able to remediate it, or at least tell us when they detect it for us.\r\n\r\nAWS rather famously was able to tell customers that they were vulnerable to heartbleed, and in many cases, block the exploits from reaching them and give their customers time to fix it.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of reasons that I'm a cloud infrastructure convert, but those are the two main ones, and to me, for most organisations, those should be no brain selections.  There are lots of worries and threats with using cloud, and of course, as referenced below, there are new attacks that can come via the cloud providers systems themselves, but given how many attack mechanisms they block off, it's almost always worth it.",

We linked the phishing attempts to a custom URL shortener, which the operators used to disguise the phishing links.\r\n\r\nWe subsequently discovered that this shortener was part of a larger network of custom URL shorteners operated by a single group, which we call Dark Basin. Because the shorteners created URLs with sequential shortcodes, we were able to enumerate them and identify almost 28,000 additional URLs containing e-mail addresses of targets. We used open source intelligence techniques to identify hundreds of targeted individuals and organizations. We later contacted a substantial fraction of them, assembling a global picture of Dark Basin\u2019s targeting.\r\n\r\nOur investigation yielded several clusters of interest that we will describe in this report, including two clusters of advocacy organizations in the United States working on climate change and net neutrality.\r\n\r\nWhile we initially thought that Dark Basin might be state-sponsored, the range of targets soon made it clear that Dark Basin was likely a hack-for-hire operation. Dark Basin\u2019s targets were often on only one side of a contested legal proceeding, advocacy issue, or business deal.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nThe malicious links we discovered during our tracking each led to credential phishing sites, i.e., websites designed to look identical to popular online web services such as Google Mail, Yahoo Mail, Facebook, and others. In addition, Dark Basin operators had created phishing websites which copied the look and feel of specific web services used or operated by the target or their organization (Figure 11).",

Some of this is about protecting myself, ensuring that I don't burn out, and making sure that I have some time at weekends to switch off and relax without worrying that I've got more to read and write about in addition to my day job.  \r\n\r\nBut protecting ourselves is about understanding our environment, our actions and taking the actions necessary to prevent the most easily preventable things from affecting us.  And that's what a lot of security programs are about as well.  It's easy to spend money on expensive systems and programmes to deliver AI and block chain and god knows what security.  But actually focusing on the most draining things, the basics that get us over and over again are some of the most valuable interventions that we can make.\r\n\r\nWe know that many threat actors simply use of the shelf tools.

According to these sources, Facebook assigned a dedicated employee to track him for around two years and developed a new machine learning system designed to detect users creating new accounts and reaching out to kids in an attempt to exploit them. That system was able to detect Hernandez and tie different pseudonymous accounts and their respective victims to him, two former Facebook employees said.\r\n\r\nSeveral FBI field offices were involved in the hunt, and the FBI made a first attempt to hack and deanonymize him, but failed, as the hacking tool they used was not tailored for Tails. Hernandez noticed the attempted hack and taunted the FBI about it, according to the two former employees.\r\n\r\nFacebook\u2019s security team, then headed by Alex Stamos, realized they had to do more, and concluded that the FBI needed their help to unmask Brian Kil. Facebook hired a cybersecurity consulting firm to develop a hacking tool, which cost six figures. Our sources described the tool as a zero-day exploit, which refers to a vulnerability in software that is unknown to the software developers. The firm worked with a Facebook engineer and wrote a program that would attach an exploit taking advantage of a flaw in Tails\u2019 video player to reveal the real IP address of the person viewing the video. Finally, Facebook gave it to an intermediary who handed the tool to the feds, according to three current and former employees who have knowledge of the events.",

The higher this cost, the less likely they are to be repeat offenders.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, cheaters can be discouraged by increasing the time commitment required when starting a new account. This can be done through tutorials, or trials which the player must complete before they can go online and play against other players.\r\n\r\nA third method is to increase the value of an account. This method uses reputation or collections so that a player might perceive their account to have added value, thus discouraging them from cheating and potentially losing that account.",

The public relations push and staggered release are reminiscent of methods used by the incredibly prolific data dumpers known as GnosticPlayers, who started selling almost a billion stolen records from numerous companies in a short period of time last year. ShinyHunters also promoted its stolen data using a few personas on open, highly trafficked platforms like Raid Forums in addition to more elite dark web marketplaces like Empire.\r\n\r\n\"It definitely does not happen every day that a new actor like this shows up,\" ZeroFox's Allen says. \"But I think a lot of cybercrime is going to start going public even more just because it\u2019s really good hype.\"\r\n\r\nAllen points out, though, that based on visible cryptocurrency payments it doesn't look like ShinyHunters has so far been wildly successful at selling its data, amassing tens of thousands of dollars, but nothing like the hundreds of thousands other groups have made.

Malware that infects a users NetBeans IDE, and it goes on to infect every project they build with that IDE.\r\n\r\nIt's not like NetBeans is the most popular UI for developers, so this as a target is interesting.  Additionally, it doesn't infect major build systems unless they are using NetBeans to conduct the build.  In the java world, Maven, Ant and similar tools are far more common.  This suggests that it may have been a targeted attack that got out into the wild, something that was picking on a specific development team that builds their project locally and deploys it (or automates a NetBeans build).",

But equally serious questions revolve around whether potential adversaries would be willing to impose comparable guidelines and restraints and, if not, whether the United States\u2019 self-restraint might put it at a disadvantage in future conflicts.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nAfter comparing military AI development efforts in the United States, China, and Russia, the authors examine those states' policy positions regarding proposals to ban or regulate the development and employment of autonomous weapons, a military application of AI that arms control advocates find particularly troubling. \r\n\r\nFinding that potential adversaries are increasingly integrating AI into a range of military applications in pursuit of warfighting advantages, they recommend that the U.S. Air Force organize, train, and equip to prevail in a world in which military systems empowered by AI are prominent in all domains. Although efforts to ban autonomous weapons are unlikely to succeed, there is growing recognition among states that risks associated with military AI will require human operators to maintain positive control in its employment.

The group Microsoft is calling \u201cPhosophorous\u201d made more than 2700 attempts to identify consumer accounts that could prove potential entry attack vectors.

However, the dialogue box actually changes when a user enters a series of characters that meet Nintendo's minimum requirements for a password. Those are the password being 8 characters in length, and containing at least two of the following: lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers, and punctuation. The password also cannot have the same character more than twice in a row. Motherboard verified Sandvik's interpretation is not correct by typing in a random series of digits that aren't a real password but which do meet those requirements; the 'OK' box lit up. This points to a quirk in the Switch's UI, but not necessarily a security vulnerability. The original article follows below. Motherboard regrets the error.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nTypically, websites and services will 'hash' a user's password, and store that rather than the plaintext password itself. A hash is essentially a one-way, cryptographic fingerprint of a piece of data. A user will type their password into the login box, the system will hash that input, and then compare it to the hash the website has on file to see if they match. If they do, the system logs the user in.\r\n\r\nBut, that would not necessarily work if Nintendo is able to tell a user that they've successfully entered the first eight characters of their password. Is Nintendo creating a hash of the first eight characters as well as another hash of the full password? Is Nintendo storing the first eight characters in plaintext?",

But it's clear that proponents of AI and it's use in multiple systems are firm believers that AI is providing a generational jump similar to the dawn of computing and the information age.\r\n\r\nOf course, the information age is more than just the growth of silicon valley, microchips and games consoles.  It's about the growth of access to information.  Not that long ago, even the worlds best governments didn't have access to sources as reliable and effective as wikipedia, let alone the steady speed of updating that happened.  It's within a generational gap that we've gone from communications taking weeks to cross oceans, to taking milliseconds to cross the planet.  The change that the information revolution bought to us was access to vast amounts of information at lightning speed.\r\n\r\nBut the disinformation and misinformation is a festering boil on the side of that.  While everyone now has access to the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), [lies can now spread round the world before the truth has got its boots on](https://freakonomics.com/2011/04/07/quotes-uncovered-how-lies-travel/).  AI is not a revolution in information distribution, it is a now much needed revolution in our ability to discern and sift through that information to find the things we are looking for.\r\n\r\nAI helps us make decisions, or in some cases takes the decisions away from us, allowing the computer to make thousands of decisions a second, all while more and more information is flowing into the system.\r\n\r\nLike all revolutions, there are those who don't believe, there are those who believe fervently without regard for the dangers, and there are those who are simply skeptical.  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that technologists tend to fall into two camps, the \"AI is simply advanced statistics\" (a quote I find about as useful as \"the cloud is other peoples computers\", both technically correct and utterly useless), or \"If we say it does AI, we'll sell 10x as many\".  We can barely even agree a definition of AI, it's such a broad school, that people arguing at one another about the proper use of it, or the ethical ramifications don't have a common agreed upon vocabulary with which to define their arguments, let alone review and understand each others perspectives.\r\n\r\nAutomated decision making is not only coming, but is already here, and is spreading into wider and wider sections of our lives.  We need a better discourse amongst ourselves to decide what the make of it, what ethical frameworks could and should exist and how to effectively use these tools and techniques for good.",

                    "note": "I've read many a draft product roadmap that has ridiculous ideas in it.  The reason is that often, when you are going out to your stakeholders, users and bosses to determine what you should do next, if you go with a blank piece of paper, you don't get useful feedback.  But if you take a strawman, you get lots of pushback, people tell you what they'd rather see, or you sometimes hit a nerve and people grab you and tell you it's amazing (Ok, I lie, I've never had that last one).  Reading such a document without context is only going to cause teams issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm less interested in the furore over the contract tracing debate (too close to my actual work, and I know too many people involved to feel like commenting is safe), than I am over what this tells me about the ability of teams to collaborate.\r\n\r\nThe contact tracing app, and the teams building it has been an amazing piece of work by a set of people drawn from across government, academia and industry.  But there's very little you can do, if you bring a team like that together fast, to enable them to collaborate effectively, easily and securely.  Google Docs allows you to specifically invite people to edit a document by google account, but not everybody has a google account, and they make need to take the document and reflect it internally.  So of course, the sensible option is to allow link sharing.  Anyone who has the URL can access the document.  \r\n\r\nIn reality, link sharing is generally secure, safe and the right thing to do in these occasions... unless the link gets exposed somewhere.  Even more annoying, Google has no way to generate a new link for a document, so if your link gets exposed, you either shut down collaboration, or you put up with the exposure.\r\n\r\nThe failure here is that a public document was sent out with links embedded in it that were either inaccessible to the public (and therefore pointless) or a public release of non-public data.  These links should never have been retained in the DPIA document that went out.  That's the issue here rather than the fact that possession of the link allows anyone to access it.",

Before defining too many roles that are overly coarse or fine-grained, it\u2019s best to try them out.

But there's a significant difference between physical assets, such as common land, and digital assets.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, digital assets are never diminished for being used.  Just because a navigation application is using geographic data doesn't mean that public garden finder app can't also use the same data.  This multiplicative effect means that even small well curated datasets can have huge impacts elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut on the negative side, there is far less connection with the owner and generator of a digital asset.  If I raise my cows on common pasture ground, then there's a limit to how far I can take them for slaughter, how far I can ship the finished goods, and of course, I likely live near the common ground and spend my profits in the local community.  But with a digital asset, the person making money off of the asset may well live in another country, and be ploughing their money into that area instead.  Digital assets don't obey country borders, and while we all benefit if the global economy is highly effective, we don't have the same economic relationships with all countries.

            "intro": "We like to think that things are either secure or insecure, that a person is trusted or not trusted, that someone is an attacker or a defender.  These dualities fill information security and lead us to lazy thinking in lots of ways around security.\r\n\r\nDualism, or black and white thinking [(A term I'm trying to avoid)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/terminology-its-not-black-and-white) tends to mean that we don't improve security, because it's either secure and doesn't need touching, or it's insecure and there's only one thing we can do, which is to it secure.  Simply improving the security of a thing a little bit doesn't really work in a world of dualities.\r\n\r\nLooking at the UK's contract tracing app document sharing thing this week is a good example.  Who should have access to our documents?  It sounds simple right, maybe we just mean our staff versus not-our-staff.  But of course, we employ lots of contractors, are they the same as an employee?  Maybe they should have access to our documents about the products we are building, but should they have unrestrained access to all of our organisations documents?  \r\n\r\nClever people start to talk about access control lists, role based access controls and group membership.  Maybe you share documents with a Google Group, or define access within Sharepoint to an organisational group or unit, and that kind of works, but it only works if you can define identity and access control for your users.  Again, the duality comes in, insiders and outsiders this time.\r\n\r\nBut not only does my team employ contractors, we have some people from consultancies come and work with me.  Doesn't really matter which ones, any systems integrator or management consultancy will do, lets call them Pac Deloittica.  But those people, should they have access to my documents?  They definitely aren't staff, and they have their own identities within their own corporate structure.  How can I effectively share information with them?  Maybe I issue temporary credentials to them, or maybe I use some fancy federation tools, but now I have different issues.  I might trust Charlotte from Pac Deloittica, but it doesn't mean I trust all 250,000 employees of Pac Deloittica to see my company files.  I may not even trust the system administrators at the consultancy, so I might not want to let them define a group that says who has access.  But the consultancy who sends me a new technical architect to every single meeting, so I don't know whether today I should share my documents with Charlotte, or with Annie, or Brenda, they're all interchangable resources to Pac Deloittica!\r\n\r\nAnd then of course, sometimes the company I'm sharing stuff with needs to reshare it internally, they need to send it to their design authority and their technical advisory board to get comments and views.  How can they do that in a way that maintains the security of the document, that ensures that only the people who are supposed to see it can see it?  \r\n\r\nThe reality is that most organisations email a copy of the file around, and never know who has it, where it goes, or what happens to it.  In a newer paradigm, we tend to email links around that require someone to authenticate to see the document.  But what happens when those links are shared wider than they should be?\r\n\r\nWe like to think that the infosec world is simple, that it's a world of dualities where there is trusted and untrusted, but the reality is that the world is a spectrum of trust, a spectrum of security behaviours, awareness, monitoring and capabilities.  When we fool ourselves into thinking this is easy, that's when we get bitten by our assumptions and faulty mental models of the world.",

With the recent Zoom 5.0 release, Zoom clients now support encrypting content using industry-standard AES-GCM with 256-bit keys. However, the encryption keys for each meeting are generated by Zoom\u2019s servers. Additionally, some features that are widely used by Zoom clients, such as support for attendees to call into a phone bridge or use in-room meeting systems offered by other companies, will always require Zoom to keep some encryption keys in the cloud. However, for hosts who seek to prioritize privacy over compatibility, we will create a new solution.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nWe are committed to remaining transparent and open as we build our end-to-end encryption offering. We plan to publish a detailed draft cryptographic design on Friday, May 22. We will then host discussion sections with civil society, cryptographic experts, and customers to share more details and solicit feedback. Once we have assessed this feedback for integration into a final design, we will announce our engineering milestones and goals for deploying to Zoom users.",

How do they track risks on projects? store penetration test results? set and enforce policies on development teams?\r\n\r\nMost of the time I am disappointed and a little scared.  The most common tool I see for all of these things is a set of spreadsheets and a shared drive for the team.  Projects take a risk log and modify it so it suits them, copies are strewn all over the place, and the number of times that i've been sent old copies of security documentation in word format that still contains tracked changes from the previous security assessor is depressing.\r\n\r\nThe world of development has mostly moved on from sending around big word documents of system specifications and test cases and thoroughly adopted the idea that in order to get faster at maintaining and adopting this stuff, it needs to be written in code and automated.  Security teams haven't really gotten there yet.\r\n\r\nI've highlighted a number of tools that have caught my eye over the last few months, from policy enforcement to infrastructure as code that is PCI compliant.\r\n\r\nBut as we move our policies and processes into code, this creates new vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit.  Adopting security as code is the next big step for many security teams, but soon after that will come the recognition that all code can have security vulnerabilities, and that includes out policy enforcement code, our infrastructure management code and our automation tools themselves.\r\n\r\nOf course, before we start worrying about that, we need mass adoption of these time saving tools.  We need security teams to recognise that infrastructure as code is more auditable, more precise and more secure than the old ways of doing things and actively encourage it.",

Machine Learning is so dependant on good data, good labelling and good people, far more so than it's dependant on the technology.\r\n\r\nOnce you have those people, you can start to engage your defence contractors by asking them to use AI effectively, rather than just general statements like adding \"The system must use AI\" to page 672 of the procurement contract.

I can't really believe that I've done this for almost 2 years now, and that I've stuck with it, and that people still message me to tell me that they find it useful.  I've said before, I mostly write this for my own use, and hopefully people find it useful as a side effect, but it forces me to be more methodical with my reading and my analysis that I do all the time anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat's next for CyberWeekly?  Hopefully another 100 issues or more!  I'm always on the lookout for thoughtful analysis, especially in areas that I'm not a specialist.  If you think that you see something useful or interesting, please feel free to send it to me, either via email, twitter or other messaging tool.  If you want to contribute more regularly, then let me know and I can provide access to the tooling that I use to write this newsletter.\r\n\r\nWhat's next is kind of a theme this week generally.  As the UK declares that it is past the worst inflection point of the COVID-19 crisis, eyes start to look ahead at what is going to happen next across the country.  The desire to return to normal is strong, and yet public polls still show that most people support staying in lockdown until the danger has passed.  But what will post COVID-19 economy, work and country look like?  Will we all start commuting back in our jam packed trains?  Will we all telecommute and continue this life of staying home and joining every meeting by videoconference?\r\n\r\nThe RSA analysis is excellent for helping give us a framework for starting to think about this.  We need to work out what processes, technologies and cultures we've adopted that we should keep doing, that we should adopt to the new normal ways of working.  We also need to be mindful of the things we are doing that we should stop.  Things that we adopted purely to cope with the crisis that don't make sense in the new world.  We can then look at things that we stopped doing that we should restart, like for example, socialising over coffee (I miss chatting with people face to face!), as well as look at things that we stopped and shouldn't start again.\r\n\r\nI don't think that the post COVID-19 world is going to look that drastically different to the pre COVID-19 world.  Many of us will drift back into the old ways because they work for us, and because we are creatures of habit.  However, I think in some areas, we will have discovered that we didn't miss certain things as much as we thought we would, and maybe that we've learnt new ways of doing things that we'll carry on doing.\r\n\r\nI hope you are all coping with life, wherever you are, and that you are taking time for yourself, time to read, to think and to decompress from the stress and pressure of coping with a long running crisis.",

As I\u2019ve said at RUSI before \u2013 we risk drowning in information; asphyxiated by a lack of understanding.\r\n\r\nThirdly that our exquisite, few, beautifully engineered \u2013 and rather large platforms \u2013 are out-paced, out-thought and out-fought by multiple, small, agile and autonomous platforms, whether in the hands of terrorist groups or challenger states.  Particularly if those adversary platforms are defined by the software that animates them rather than the armour and weaponry that weighs us down.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t have an innovation problem \u2013 quite the opposite, a thousand innovative flowers are blooming across Defence, whether in the Services, the DE&S or the DIO, the Ministry itself, or our peerless scientists in dstl.  But we do have an \u2018innovation adoption\u2019 problem \u2013 we struggle to incorporate those innovations into our core capabilities and focus real investment on them.  The old saying is \u2018think big; start small; and be prepared to scale \u2013 or fail\u2019.  But we are bad at \u2018scaling\u2019 and we are simply awful at \u2018failing\u2019 old ideas to make way for new ones.  As Liddell Hart used to say \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s not so hard getting a new idea into a military mind; but it\u2019s very hard to get an old one out\u2019.  \r\n\r\nWe are good at doing things better \u2013 but we are bad at imagining our way to doing better things.  So, for me the key opportunities lie in \u2018hacking\u2019 our culture \u2013 taking us back to our better selves, when we were prepared to think the unthinkable to achieve a generational edge on our competitors.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll focus on three areas of opportunity, where I think we can hack our culture to get back to where we used to be:\r\n\r\nThe first area is collaboration.  Like many large, established organisations, we are fixated by our structural boundaries.  We like to tell people to \u2018stay in lane\u2019\u2026  But that\u2019s not the way to win the 21st Century, which is a time of collaboration, cooperation and integration.  And there is little chance of Defence or the Services suffering from too little competition.\r\n\r\nThe second area is risk.  The risk aversion is exhausting us; it\u2019s tying up our resources \u2013 in particular our people but also our money and critically our time; and it\u2019s turning off our brightest and best.  They want to move at the speed of relevance and in a disruptive age that means taking very significant risks.  In the Digital space this is tricky \u2013 with our mantra of \u2018Secure First\u2019.  But when you get under the skin that doesn\u2019t mean cutting ourselves off from our partners \u2013 rather it means \u2018designing in\u2019 features that allow us to take risks knowingly and for the right reasons.\r\n\r\nLast it will really help us in all this if we can breed a culture in which we recognise and value data as the strategic asset that it is.

These are challenges around collaboration, around risk and around use of data.\r\n\r\nThe last few weeks of lockdown in the UK has shown to me just how unprepared most organisations and specifically, most security teams within organisations are in these areas.  When we've needed to collaborate the most, security teams have over-egged the risks that collaboration tools provide, and have lacked the basic access to data to backup their points about said risk.  Security has yet again been at worst a blocker or at best irrelevant for organisations trying to cope with changing and trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nI really like these challenges set out by the Major General, they really show the challenges facing most major organisations around the world. The challenge that our staff need increasingly complex and capable ways of interacting and collaborating.  The old silo's of work places just don't cut it anymore, and instead we see small multi-disciplinary teams that have members from different areas of the organisation, and all wanting to collaborate on the same projects.  This often means discovering that our standard issue corporate tools of Word and Excel are just not up to the task, and we need to enable people to take notes, to sketch ideas, to organise their time, and of course to work in a variety of places.\r\n\r\nI feel I've spoken endlessly about the problems of risk assessment, and our understanding of risk, so I'm going to skip that area.\r\n\r\nBut our access to data, and our ability to understand data is generally lacking in many organisations.  Instead of fast moving ability to understand data, the ability to use modern data science tools and multidisciplinary teams, we tend to see vast slow enterprise data products, huge data lakes that are slow to be updated, impossible to get analytics out of, and require the use of enterprise tooling to create dashboards that are mostly almost as bad as the data that gets put into them.\r\n\r\nWe need to understand our data more by artfully considering the insights we need to glean, and then going back to capture the data that is needed to provide those insights.  Rarely, when faced with a soup of low value data, have we been able to generate useful insights.  Skilled data analysis requires input at all levels, including understanding the data needs of decision makers, both at executive level and at delivery level, as well as understanding what's possible and the privacy and security implications of gathering the data.\r\n\r\nMajor General Copinger-Syme is right to highlight these areas as ones that we need to address and try to fix in our organisations.  We won't fix these with overarching enterprise architectures or governance structures that change organisations, we'll fix these with small multi-disciplinary teams who have the ability and authority to work across silos to develop appropriate ways of working, and to demonstrate the value of a transformed organisation.",

The problem here is the lack of accountability, governance and reporting.  \r\n\r\nThe DOD security bigwigs told everyone that they needed to use the new awareness program, but many of the departments feel no need to report to the CIO on the progress of those tasks.  of 17 tasks, the CIO is responsible for 10 of them, and is reporting on them, but 7 of them have no effective ownership within the organisation and therefore nobody is saying whether they've been done.\r\n\r\nThis mirrors the complexity in many organisations, the CISO or CTO can implement some measures within their teams, but do they have the authority or capability to know whether other business units are doing what they say?\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest investments a security team can make is improving self reporting, making people feel like talking to security is a pleasurable experience that doesn't evoke fear of being told off, and ensure that there are good easy avenues to report this stuff.",

Each security key you own must be registered with each service you wish to use it on such as Google, 1Password, Facebook, GitHub, et cetera.\r\n\r\nYou'll register each key one by one. Usually navigating to the website's settings page related to two-factor auth and finding a button to add a key. This assumes you've already setup two-factor auth. Then when prompted you plug your key in and tap it. Depending on the website you may be prompted to type in a name for each key. This step is vital as it helps you identify which key to remove from the service in the event you lose that key and have multiple registered on the same service.22\r\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much it. Once a key is registered with a service, the next time you log in 23 it's as easy as touching your security key when prompted after entering your username and password.",

Having a dedicated network for IoT devices where they can compromise each other and get out to the internet, but can't compromise your desktops/laptops/phones etc, isn't a bad move.

This is not connected to the Internet or any network. It has power and is connected to a single LED light, and this computer contains sensitive information in it. I then hire you (and you happen to be malicious) to write some code that turns this light on or off for me, based on some code you write.\r\n\r\nMaybe the algorithm you write tells me to buy or sell a stock based on whether the light turns on or off. Your only input to me is a physical CD I put in the computer, and I run your code on this computer while I\u2019m there by myself. You aren\u2019t in the room. Under these circumstances, it is possible to avoid having you learn whether the light was turned on or off, and without exfilling the sensitive data from the computer out. We can assume that precautions have been taken to avoid the attacker monitoring the power usage to the room, TEMPEST monitoring, or other threats.\r\n\r\nAlthough contrived, this is a rough enough approximation of some real-world situations, especially those worried about inside threats.\r\n\r\nExample in AWS\r\nNow we want to recreate this setup in AWS, so instead of a local physical computer we have an EC2, and instead of an LED, a message is sent to an SQS. You give me code to run on the EC2, and it sends a 1 or 0 to the SQS. In order to have an isolated network, the VPC this EC2 runs in has no Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, IPv6 Egress-Only Gateway, or other means of communicating out to the Internet or from the Internet into the network.

            "intro": "I've spent a long time working in Agile.  I was on one of the first really big agile programmes of work at the Guardian, and introduced to many of the concepts by people who went on to be great thinkers and definers in agile development.  \r\n\r\nAs I've grown through the process however, I've noticed that a lot of people proclaiming the wonder of agile have a strong distaste for any form of \"Governance\".  They use it as a dirty word, to sum up and summarise the weeks and months that projects spend trying to get approval for change, or release authority, or technical design authorities. \r\n\r\nWe confuse authority of decision making for informational awareness all the time, and we call both \"Governance\".\r\n\r\nAs organisations, the leaders need to know what decisions are being made in the organisation in order to lead effectively.  The old [Spotify model](https://medium.com/productmanagement101/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761) trope, where a leader provides direction to bring \"alignment\", but allows teams autonomy to make decisions on how to get to the solution to the problem requires leaders to both identify and communicate a problem, but also if they are to iterate their goals, their directions and the articulation of the problem, requires them to have visibility and understanding of the decisions that teams are making.\r\n\r\nThis ability to see and understand where teams are making decisions, to see outliers where someone is doing something novel and unusual and be able to drill down into why is the heart of Governance.  If your teams make technical decisions, and I believe that delivery teams must be enabled to make their own decisions, then you also need some mechanism for those decisions to be recorded and to be broadcast out to other teams, and up the management chain.\r\n\r\nIf you have 20 teams, and you declare that you think that the only true agile governance is through \"show and tells\", then you are requiring every manager to put aside 20 x 30 minute slots of time each week/fortnight/iteration to see what the teams are doing.  You also need the teams to agree on who gets what time slot to ensure that senior managers can go to every show and tell, that none overlap.  If you grow your organisation to 100 teams, then your entire executive board no longer has any working time in a given week for any work other than going to show and tells.\r\n\r\nInstead, we need technical governance, mechanisms where tech leads can coordinate, feedback and increase team alignment without slowing down the teams.  We need cultural governance that allows team structures and delivery artefacts to be consistent, so that reporting and understanding of the teams is nicely aligned.  We need all these governance mechanisms to understand where people make decisions that deviate from the majority of teams, in order to understand whether that team has a unique context, or whether the default decision for the organisation needs to change.\r\n\r\nWithout these mechanisms in place, you can set out what you want to achieve all you like, but you'll never know whether your vision is being delivered upon, because in any organisation of any reasonable size, you just won't get the feedback about the effectiveness of your problem definition, you won't get feedback on how effectively your current technology and culture works and you won't know whether you are being effective.\r\n\r\nGovernance isn't a dirty word, it's even more necessary in the [volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) that agile works with so effectively.",

It's possible, and indeed, I'd recommend buying more than one key or key type.  I have a backup key that is held in case I lose my main one.  You can add a second key to almost every service that supports yubikeys (With the annoying exception of AWS), and even a third.  This means you can buy both a USB-C connecting one and an NFC one if you want.\r\n\r\n2. iOS support is more than a little flaky.  I don't use mine with my phone at all.  Most services have some work arounds, Google requires me to be at a computer where I can use the key to generate a code to type into my device, and many services support using a standard TOTP service like Authy or Google Authenticator instead.\r\n\r\nThe use of hardware keys is something you really only want to enable for high value accounts.   It can be fiddly to go find them when needed.

            "url": "None", 
            "intro": "I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think the global quarantines are going to end anytime soon.\r\n\r\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [thinks that UK deaths will continue rising and peak around April 17th](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-kingdom) (but look at those error ranges!) but with deaths still likely to continue through to May.  However worldwide other nations are looking in similarly bad shape and the US in particular is looking like deaths may well continue through to June.\r\n\r\nIf your quarantine strategy is to handle a couple of weeks of \"working from home\", then you need to start rethinking what your plans are.  There could well be \"travel only if necessary, work from home wherever you can\" government guidance in place for a few more months at least.\r\n\r\nOrganisations are generally struggling to come to terms with this mass working from home, mostly I think because they insist on considering it to be working from home.  This WFH experience is something that many of us have experienced, we have a delivery or something happening that means that we can't be in the office for a day or two.  We tend to put off some of the tasks we normally do and focus on work we can do while relaxing at home.  We dial into all of our normal meetings where possible and we essentially recreate the office experience, just with ourselves away and cut off from the normal team working.\r\n\r\nBut as many people who work from home more regularly have been saying, there is a fundamental shift when it comes to moving from working from home occasionally to teleworking constantly to becoming distributed.  I'm sure you've been in meetings before where you felt like \"this could have been an email\", but the sheer quantity of video calls I've been in recently that were really unnecessary in many cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of how distributed you are, I've got some tips that I think organisations should follow now if they haven't already.  If you want to be a successful distributed organisation, you should do the following:\r\n\r\n### Get Google's GSuite for productivity\r\n\r\nYup, I'm sure that Microsofts Office 365 is almost as good, but in reality, for distributed consensus working, I cannot recommend working on a paper in Google Docs highly enough.  The ability to have a single document, for multiple people to edit at once, to switch into suggestion mode and make improvements and suggestions to a document, these are things that are almost essential for good distributed teams.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, GSuite is more secure than your current office estate, fewer emails going around with attachments, few copies of the data being downloaded onto devices.  You can allow BYOD access from iPads and Tablets, and while not as good as a computer, you get a good experience.\r\n\r\nGSuite has strong user identity controls, and if you signup to the the Advanced Protection program (requires 2 security keys, see below), then you'll have world class protection of your accounts and email systems.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot use GSuite then moving to Office 365 is a good alternative.  It brings many of the security controls that you want, while enabling the web access features of O365 means that your staff can work easily from home.\r\n\r\n### Get slack\r\n\r\nFor creating a sense of team conversation, slack is amazing.  It can be a time sink and it can have all kinds of issues around attention, but nothing works as well and easily as slack for maintaining a feeling of \"being part of the team\" like shared team channels in slack.\r\nEncourage your staff to have a team channel that isn't private, let people sit in other teams channels so they see or hear things that they wouldn't normally.  the transparency and openness helps recreate the overheard conversations and serendipity that you normally get from colocation in an office.\r\nAdditionally, actively encourage channels that are non work related.  When people are in the office they talk while making coffee or at the \"water cooler\", they talk about their weekends, their families, their cats.  so create channels where people can discuss their hobbies, their lives.  This creates a sense of community.\r\n\r\n### Use modern web tools for collaboration\r\n\r\nIn this category I consider tools like Miro, Trello, Jira and so on.  These tools should be ones that are designed for the internet age, that assume that users are distributed and that security is provided via authentication.  If you can sign in with your google account as the recommended way of signing in, then it's a good tool.\r\n\r\nThese tools often allow multiple people to interact with the same thing at the same time, which makes it easier to not need to have a video call about it.  You can all contribute to a virtual whiteboard like Miro, seeing how people are moving their cursor around and what they are typing.  This helps the team feel like they know what everyone is doing.\r\n\r\n### Provide password managers for all staff\r\n\r\nYou are going to have to put more stuff online on the internet.  Your staff are going to need to have lots more user accounts for all of these new systems and services.  If you can, you want people signing in with their Google account.  You know that's well protected and it's a single source of truth for leavers, but not everything will let you do that.  Additionally, you really want users using different passwords everywhere.  Provide them with a free tool that creates and stores different passwords. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you aren't in the office, it's far harder to share passwords with your colleagues.  While we sometimes bemoan the password written on a post-it, in reality it is far more secure against many remote attackers than we like to admit.  Good modern password managers lets you have a team account where you can share passwords with each other, see when they are rotated and who has used them.  This lets you manage the passwords that needs to be shared effectively.\r\n\r\n###  Invest in FIDO hardware keys like Yubikeys\r\n\r\nFor your Google accounts, and VPN's and maybe even for unlocking corporate devices, nothing is better than these hardware keys.  Some of your staff don't live in a nice multi-million pound house in Surrey, some of them live in shared apartments with slightly dodgy roommates.  They cannot keep an eye on their devices 100% of the time, but they can attach a USB key to their house keys, so that their computer cannot be used when they go out.\r\n\r\n###  Invest in security monitoring\r\n\r\nForget disabling copy and paste, forget requiring a VPN for everything, forget requiring staff to dance the dance of VPN's and RDP servers and prviilege escalation to look up a phone number.  All of those security controls add stress to an already stressed set of staff, and they'll work around those controls if they have to.  They'll switch to using their personal gmail accounts and using off corporate systems just to avoid your restrictive controls.\r\n\r\nThe most important control you need is to understand the health of the device and account that someone uses.  That's your biggest risk right now, so monitor for it.  Invest in an MDM that can tell you how patched your devices are.  GSuite has some minor features here, and integrates with other tools when needed.  All of your corporate laptops and devices should be logging some data on the endpoint and shipping it into a centralised monitoring solution.  This will let you know if any of your devices have been compromised and enable you to either fix it, or tell the user what action to take.\r\n\r\nIn these times, we need to make sure that security is enabling people to get on with their job, get it done well and get it done with the minimum of difficulty.  These suggestions may not line up with your 5 year cybersecurity strategy, but if you cannot show value during this time, then you won't be considered valuable during the easy times either.",

They are sometimes retrofitted into a shape that separate teams may use, but it\u2019s quite rare that they truly fit that use-case.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe need to embrace a new perspective, built on this new reality of \u201cinfrastructure as application\u201d. Such rethinking is a big task, and not one I can summarise in a few simple bullets, but here are some examples of changes to consider:\r\n\r\n* Reconsider your security org structure for securing cloud products. Security for IT stacks was designed to partner well with the IT org structure, but security for application stacks should be structured to work with the development organization. I have much more to say about this topic, but that will likely be a post on its own\u2026\r\n\r\n* Understand the application developer\u2019s needs. Take the time to understand their reality, not just their technology, and aim to adapt your practices, tools and expectations to match theirs. The industry best practices are often based on the needs of IT, not dev, so don\u2019t rely on them.\r\n\r\n* Don\u2019t assume your existing pre-cloud solutions are the right ones for cloud apps. While keeping the same tools across your old and new stacks is convenient, it\u2019s unlikely they will serve both realities well. Check what other tools your vendor has to offer \u2014 or other vendors around \u2014 and choose the right tool for the cloud environment.\r\n\r\n* Invest in flexible, API-driven, self-serve security tools. IT teams are a central function, allowing you to invest more time in custom integration. Dev teams and stacks vary significantly more. Invest in tools that can adapt to different surroundings, while providing similar security controls and governance.\u00a0",

But the learning is often restricted only to the people who were involved in the incident.  We write up incident responses but do we ever make use of them?  Do we read them?\r\n\r\nThis move by the FT to actively make incident responses easier to search, easier to read and easier to access is a strong move towards active learning within the organisation which enables everyone to learn from these outages.  The other thing, then is the fact that they go back and reuse the incidents in simulations.

Two of those are called Skype but have vastly different user experiences, and lots of people got on board with Skype for calling family back in 2015 or so and were badly burnt by all the changes.

            "intro": "I\u2019m bored of the Zoom infosec debacle at the moment, so I thought I\u2019d look more at one of my favourite hobby horses, the adoption and use of the cloud and how to use it securely.\r\n\r\nCloud computing has been around for a long time, and infosec professionals have spent a long time sneering at it.  If I go to an infosec conference, I guarantee that I\u2019ll see \u201cthe cloud is just other peoples computers\u201d stickers on a large percentage of laptops around the place.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been lucky enough to be at the forefront of the move to cloud, as, I suspect have many of you who are reading.  [Forbes reckonend back in 2018 that about 41% of enterprise workloads will be on public cloud](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/01/07/83-of-enterprise-workloads-will-be-in-the-cloud-by-2020/#3b7ad92b6261) by 2020, with another 40% in private or hybrid clouds.  That still means that 1/5 workloads have not been shifted to cloud.  The estimates are that something like 95% of companies have some cloud resources now, but that\u2019s been growing fast, wind back just a couple of years and there were still around 1/3rd of companies that weren\u2019t using cloud computing.\r\n\r\nThe biggest concern that is often quoted is that of security.  It doesn\u2019t matter which business intelligence reports you read, Gartner, Forbes, you name it, they all come back with the same result... Security concerns are the reason that companies haven't adopted cloud as fast as they would would like, and security concerns are cited by leaders.  But where do those leaders get those security concerns?  Probably from their security professionals in their organisations, the ones who have the faulty thinking about the operating model of cloud computing.\r\n\r\nThe failure here, as always, is the failure of applying a previous generational set of tools and processes to a new generation of capabilities.  The processes that you use to manage a physical data center are optimised over years of being applied to physical infrastructure and are therefore inherintly flawed in attempting to manage cloud workloads.  The cost of creating and destroying equipment is orders of magnitude smaller in cloud environments, which means that processes that assume that resources must be shared and therefore need coordination are wholly inappropriate.  It also means that security properties that we used to worry about, in particular the administration of shared components are no longer the ones that we should be worrying about.\r\n\r\nThe new security properties, tools and processes that you need to apply to cloud computing are also just as important in their lack of adoption.  Many of the public S3 buckets should have and could have been caught by modern practices, but instead older practices cannot pivot fast enough to catch that kind of problem.  \r\n\r\nWe need to move beyond \u201cthe cloud is other peoples computers\u201d as if that\u2019s the big risk, and move towards standardising the proper use of cloud computing.  The ubiquitous, convenient and on-demand access to computing resources that cloud provides is exactly the thing that has enabled business agility and allowed some of the amazing teams in Government to spin up valuable resources for citizens during the pandemic. When we look back at the government handling of this pandemic, and the services that were created, we\u2019ll see a marked difference in the offerings between the departments that had cloud native development capabilities, and those that just considered cloud to be another data center.",

Yes, in the long run the elevated humidity poses a structural risk that may make the house uninhabitable, or at least a place no one wants to live. But right now, the house is on fire. We need to pour water on it.\r\n\r\nIn our case, the fire is the global pandemic and the severe economic crisis it has precipitated. Once the initial shock wears off, we can expect this to be followed by a political crisis, in which our society will fracture along pre-existing lines of contention.\r\n\r\nBut once the initial outbreak is contained, we will face a dilemma. Do we hurt people by allowing the economy to collapse entirely, or do we hurt people by letting the virus spread again? How do we reconcile the two?\r\n\r\nOne way out of the dilemma would be some kind of medical advance\u2014a vaccine, or an effective antiviral treatment that lowered the burden on hospitals. But it is not clear how long the research programs searching for these breakthroughs will take, or whether they will succeed at all.\r\n\r\nWithout these medical advances, we know the virus will resume its spread as soon as the harsh controls are lifted.\r\n\r\nDoctors and epidemiologists caution us that the only way to go back to some semblance of normality after the initial outbreak has been brought under control will be to move from population-wide measures (like closing schools and making everyone stay home) to an aggressive case-by-case approach that involves a combination of extensive testing, rapid response, and containing clusters of infection as soon as they are found, before they have a chance to spread.\r\n\r\nThat kind of case tracking has traditionally been very labor intensive.

It's felt a little like fiddling while rome burns to be honest.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that annoys me is that privacy policies are so rarely written in any depth that I need to make sensible decisions about the system.  Software as a Service companies frequently have wide open privacy policies that actively confuse the privacy impacts of ad tracking on the site, my personal data as the administrator/staff user of the service, and personal data that might be uploaded as part of the use of the service.\r\n\r\nFor example, take [Atlassian's privacy policy for Trello](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) (and other Atlassian products).  This defines information they collect to include my details when I sign up, content I submit to the site, ad tracking cookies and analytics amongst others.  The next section down says that it uses information it collects to provide the service, for research and development, to market the product and so on.\r\n\r\nBut there's no mapping in there about whether there's a difference between the sources of information and what they do with it.  If I create a Trello board called \"My Doctors Appointments\" and start storing cards in there about various doctors appointments, would I expect that they could use that content for marketing of products?  I don't think anybody would think that was reasonable, and yet that is what the privacy policy says is acceptable.\r\n\r\nHow about sharing of the data?  Clearly they need a legal basis for enabling the features of the application to let me add other third parties to a board, so they must be able to share the data with a third party.  Atlassians privacy policy is actually one of the better ones here, in that they are quite specific about who they share with, but it's still a little hard to squint and work out if it's only shared with people I approve of, or whether it's shared with anyone that Atlassian decides is a collaborator.  Several other SaaS services I've reviewed recently have privacy policies that allow them to share your data with anyone else who uses the service.  \r\n\r\nThe problem here is that we tend to lump data into a couple of fairly black and white buckets.  Personal data and non-personal data.  Privacy policies are written mostly to protect the company, which means that the privacy policy is written to allow as much as legally possible while sounding like they are safe guardians of our data.  But we don't really know what happens to our data.\r\n\r\nI've seen people online asking this week whether it's a breach of GDPR for the UK Government to send everyone a text message (it's not for numerous reasons, too many to recount, I should write a blog post why), and I've seen the online debate about whether we should use mobile phone tracking data to track our movements during an outbreak like this.\r\n\r\nI don't have any good answers to this stuff because it's nowhere nearly as simple as it's all made out to be.  What actually is our personal data, what do we mean when we say we want privacy, and how can it be used when there is a legitimate threat to life are all tough questions in this policy area.\r\n\r\nIf we are lucky, we'll come out of this with a better, more nuanced view on what data we give up, whether it's worth it and appropriate access for the state to that data.  But given the current level of public discourse, I worry that we'll end up with one side yelling about abuse of power and data, and the other side yelling about public health emergencies with little grey in between the two position.",

                    "quote": "Nearly all of the garrison of the castle were at church in the town attending Mass. There were two guards left behind on the gate. A carpenter from the castle approached the guards saying that he needed to perform some work with two of his assistants. They were admitted and then immediately stabbed both guards. They then quickly let in the rest of their men, locking the gates behind them. When the garrison arrived back from church they were unable to gain access to the castle.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the cleverness of this takeover was undermined by the fact that there were few stores in the castle and the Welsh were not prepared for it. It also upset the King of England, Henry IV, who immediately besieged the castle. Within three months, with no edible stores, the Welsh were starved out.\r\n\r\nWhy is this story particularly interesting in a technology context? This kind of strategy has many parallels with the way in which hackers often use guile and skill to attack seemingly impenetrable defences. The attack was planned to happen when the castle would be least defended and a way of gaining access via an authorized method had been found. The guards authenticated that the carpenter was real and he was clearly authorized to be there. The defenders were not correctly using their layers of defence within the castle and showed complacency and over-familiarity.\r\n\r\nThe story also gives a lesson for attackers looking to compromise and remain in a system. When defences have been subverted, one thing that more advanced attackers do in the technology world is what\u2019s called \u2018living off the land\u2019. In this case the attackers were not able to sustain their takeover of the castle because they lacked those resources to hold out for a long time. Indeed, they\u2019d misperceived the real situation. In the technology world, it is good practice to minimize in advance the things that an attacker can use once they\u2019re \u201cin the castle\u201d or onto a system, such as software libraries not used for the core operation of a system. In the case of the story above, it was bad luck for the attackers that the garrison had so few usable supplies and food.",

            "url": "None", 
            "intro": "As pretty much every organisation in the UK and US has made urgent moves towards remote working, there are security and technology teams scrambling to enable remote access for their staff and to make it work.  VPN's are being overloaded, broadband connections saturated and terminal service licenses being exceeded in many organisations.\r\n\r\nSecurity has to enable this kind of work as fast as possible, but when work is rushed, it can increase the risk of a security vulnerability.  The simple ones are things like deploying your technology wrongly, in such a way that it's easy to bypass or steal data.  But the more insidious issues is the putting online of systems that assumed that they were secure because nobody unauthorised had access.  We know that many criminal and government backed hacking groups are using the crisis as an opportunity to attack organisations through their weak spots.\r\n\r\nZero trust networking and similar ideas all flow from the central premise that you can securely and safely identify the personal accessing the service via some identity mechanism.  If you migrate online in a rush, you are far more likely to miss the features of your identity system that protect those services.  These critical blocks are important to get right, but really hard to do so in a hurry.\r\n\r\nIf you are moving to online productivity tooling, then you may well be exposing your current authentication infrastructure to the wider internet.  Do you have things in place to perform rate limiting on authentication attempts?  Do you have logging to know whether you are under attack and whether any credentials have been compromised?  Leading providers, such as Microsofts Azure AD has all of these features if you choose to enable them, but if you are simply putting your current infrastructure online, then you need to add these features.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is that current responses will lead, inevitably, to the growth of Shadow IT. Of people working around the IT department because it doesn't seem to meet their needs.  As someone in IT, you'll feel like you are doing all you can, but often we don't listen to our customers, who want something quick, something easy and something that just works.  If you give them something too restrictive, then they won't use it.  [This story over at reddit is a good example](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/fm6f4m/shadow_it_apocalypse/).  At this time, I think the most important thing that a cybersecurity team can be aware of is what is being used and installed.  Create a software amnesty.  Create a simple online form or slack channel where people can tell you what they are using to share documents, have video conferences and so on.  Don't rush to defend your existing IT offering, but assume that they've picked that for some reason (good or bad).  Instead you can use it to monitor what is happening in the organisation and decide where to offer your support.  Look at how to monitor it for bad actors, and see if you can enable healthy good practices on it.\r\n\r\nThe final thought is that this will soon(ish) be over, but many of the decisions that we make during this time will live on.  The more you know now, the better your chances of running a successful \"post-covid cleanup\" project, where you attempt to go find people who started using some new online tool and either migrate them to an officially sanctioned tool, or officially sanction the tool that they've found and roll it out to your enterprise.",

Ok, maybe I've tortured that analogy a little far, but the thing I'm trying to say is that we are asking people to change the way they work, to change their culture and the way that they think, but we often require the same sets of artifacts and processes that they've always had to produce and work through.\r\n\r\nI'm working with teams at the moment around agile governance, and one of things that we identify is that we want to work in an agile and iterative way, but that at some point, the organisation requires us to conduct a data protection impact assessment for the data that we are going to hold.  And our organisation has a proforma document that we must produce as part of that process.  But this document, this artifact, is almost impossible to produce using the agile and iterative tools that we have, and so we get people like me acting as an interpreter and trying to produce a document that looks right for what we are doing.\r\n\r\nWhat hope is there for this new culture to catch on in the rest of the organisation that isn't lucky enough to have somoene like me doing this for them?  Instead they'll be told \"be agile, think user first\", but also \"you need to produce document X, project plan Y, business case Z\".\r\n\r\nWhen we approach digital transformation, we often start with culture and ways of working.  We try to break people out of the habit of the ways that they traditionally worked.  But we underestimate the power of the tools that we give people.  The tools that we use shape the way that we think, because when we hold a screwdriver, we look for screw shaped problems, and when we hold a hammer, we look for nail shaped problems.\r\n\r\nWhat if your team had a one or two of developers who wrote tools for everyone to use?  What if those tools encouraged iterative thinking and iterative decision making, and achieved the aim that you want?  What if when you start a project, you had to go to a data protection tool that asked you some basic questions, and you could go back to it, week after week and update the information in it.  What if that tool allowed the data protection team to see the current snapshot state of each teams data protection thinking, and enabled them to determine who had done a healthy impact assessment, and who needed help?\r\n\r\nI'm used to web development (it's been 15 years since I wrote anything but websites), and so I look at this as being a web based tool, but it might be a google forms, or a surveymonkey page, or a sharepoint site.  But the value of the tool is that you can use it to define people's thinking, to encourage them to engage in a specific way.  How are you asking people to tell you about their risks?  How are you tracking project progress or financial spend? What tools do you give people to use in these areas and how are they shaping their thinking?  \r\n\r\nMaybe the failure of transformation projects is because we spend too much time talking about culture, ways of working, governance and process and not enough time just giving people the right shaped tools and showing them how to use them.",

It\u2019s not like they got details of every single user who was even nearby, they selected individuals who they felt were particuarly suspicious.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem here, and it\u2019s addressed later in the article, is that people don\u2019t trust the police and what they\u2019ll do with that data.

If Micah Lee, the technologist working with the Intercept on some of the snowdon leaks, working with Tor, the EFF and various other places, can travel around for 2 years, internationally and nationally, and not have a computer that they keep even booted, let alone interfered with.  Then how likely is it that a member of your staff is going to be subject to a physical hardware attack?  I think this brings the likelihood of evil maid attacks down to practically zero unless you have reason to believe that you will be specific targeted.  As an organisation, implementing all the cool doodads that might protect against physical evil maid attacks are probably a waste of time and budget, not to mention often creating a usability concern with the device.

Those who are given a dispensation from prosecution in order to carry out their jobs, and those who maintain those systems.  In general, the systems administrators are completely forbidden from ever, even accidentally, seeing imagery that is contained on the systems that they manage.  Thats both to protect them from committing a crime while at work, but also a safeguarding issue, as nobody should be exposed to such imagery without good counselling and mental health safeguards around them.\r\n\r\nSo this seems a little odd to me.

They originally annoucned that they would revoke them all with a fairly short timeline, but have rowed back on that for a couple of reasons.  The first is that they had only identified a few hundred where the bug actually led to certificates being issued that weren\u2019t in keeping with their guidelines.  More importantly, they found nearly a million certificates where the users were not going to be able to reissue fast enough.\r\n\r\nThe bug itself is rather niche.  Firstly you need to be using CAA on your domains, and you needed to request a single certificate that spanned multiple domains.  CAA is a special kind of DNS record that says that \u201cwe use Certificate Authority X, so only they can issue certificates for this domain\u201d.  So for example, if you were running a system that had multiple customers, so a.foo, b.foo and c.foo, and all 3 had CAA on the subdomain.  When LetsEncrypt issued the certificate, they accidentally checked that a.foo was valid with CAA policies, but not b.foo and c.foo.  \r\n\r\nIn many cases, all the domains had a valid CAA records that would have checked validly, but since LetsEncrypt hadn\u2019t checked, they had broken the rules.\r\n\r\nAs LetsEncrypt has said, the potentially million certificates that haven\u2019t been rechecked will all expire within 3 months, and it sounds like they are going to wait a little longer before revoking those certificates, by which time some of them will have automatically renewed and the affected customer set will be smaller.",

It does not even rule out the possibility that now CIA is able to track down the real-time global flight status, passenger information, trade freight and other related information.

This further confirms the source of these cyberweapons. After in-depth analysis and decryption of the version in the Fluxwire backdoor in the Vault 7, Qihoo 360 statistically classified the version, attack time, and samples captured by itself that APT-C-39 used to attack targets in China over the years",

            "intro": "You may have seen the [\"interesting\" video about backdoors from Huawei this week](https://twitter.com/Huawei/status/1235128718869164032?s=20), which has been widely panned as company based propaganda.  However it does raise an interesting point (and referencing the story from last week), that legally mandated lawful interception points are also backdoors into systems.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, there are a lot of bad people on the internet, and even democratic societies have mechanisms for ensuring that police are able to restrict or reduce the liberty of an individual because they seek harm or reduction of liberty of another individual.  Different western societies have very different models for what balance is the right balance of restrictions on personal liberties versus the need of the state to ensure a safe environment for the many.  This can be a sticky political point for many people, with people drawing different decisions about where they think these rules should lie.\r\n\r\nIn the physical realm, very few UK people believe that physical search warrants issued by a judge are not a legally acceptable mechanism for controlling the polices ability to search a property or person.  The controls require a level of reasonable suspicion and the very physical nature tends to prevent large scale dragnets of search.  In the cyber realm, the physical restrictions are lifted, but the principles still apply.  People generally require policing to require a level of reasonable suspicion in order to search their digital life.\r\n\r\nIan Levy and Crispin Robbins wrote about this back in [Principles for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate](https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate)\r\n\r\n> There is no single solution to enable all lawful access, but we definitely don\u2019t want governments to have access to a global key that can unlock any user\u2019s data. Government controlled global key escrow systems would be a catastrophically dumb solution in these cases. Furthermore, solutions should be designed so the service provider\u2014in the form of a real human\u2014is involved in enacting every authorized request, limiting the scale of use.\r\n\r\nThe clear principle set out here is that global unfettered access is not wanted, and that instead there should be a process within Government for creating an authorised request, and a process within service providers for validating that request.\r\n\r\nOf course, the corollary to this is that service providers may discover illegal content and behaviour of their users through their normal mechanism.  At that point, should they report it to the authorities without requiring the duly authorised warrant?  The story about how Apple engages with law enforcement for cases of child abuse imagery might point at how some of that stuff works.  Just because law enforcement has a minimum bar for service providers behaviour, requiring warrants etc, there is nothing to stop a service provider being more compliant if they feel that it is within their company ethos to do so.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the question of how and whether law enforcement gets a second bite of the apple is an interesting one.  The Google case below shows that law enforcement ask for non-personally identifiable information in order to potentially identify devices that they wish to investigate further.  \r\n\r\nI think a lot of the problems of this stuff comes from the lack of transparency by authorities.  Publishing statistics on searches conducted, %-age hit rates and outcomes would give us a lot more confidence in the systems.  We don't want a world where there is a 100% suspicion to arrest rate, because there will always be random situations that look suspicious to outsiders, but we want to see that there is a required high chance of converting a hunch into an actual lead in order to justify the intrusion into peoples civil liberties.  Obviously, investigators don't want to tip their hand about certain investigations, but if searches are being conducted to find regular criminals such as burglars, then the worries about those criminals monitoring issued warrants to see if they are discovered don't really hold water for me.\r\n\r\nTwo editorial notes as well this week.  I've deliberately chosen not to feature any stories about COVID-19.  There's enough disinformation floating around, and I simply don't know enough to be able to sift good information from bad.  There's a few things that I've noted that I may go back to once the concern and hype settles down, but I'm not going to cover it in here until I'm sure and confident that I won't add to confusion online.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you may notice that I've moved from Saturday mornings to Sunday mornings.  Looking at my statistics, about 50% of you read the newsletter over the weekend, and the other 50% of you read this Monday/Tuesday morning.  It's slightly easier for me to find time to prep the newsletter if I can write some on Saturday and Sunday morning than it is preparing on a Friday, but if this is affecting your Saturday morning routine, do let me know, and if there's enough feedback, I'll change it back.",

                    "note": "This is a 350 page document and is desperately in need of some form or tl;dr; so I'll do my best.\r\n\r\nThis is a good stab at trying to articulate what a career in government security might look like.  It covers all forms of security, from close protection officer to behavioural scientist, from digital forensics to software installer, from penetration tester to chief security officer.  It really suffers from the breadth because it feels like it's trying to cover every possible role in government security, and yet feels like it fails to deliver, especially on the edges of the careers (as viewed by the authors).\r\n\r\nThe biggest issues from my perspective is that it still has a fairly dated view of security in many perspectives.  While it has been kept up to date with the developments in the Digital, Date and Technology professions in government, it still lacks in real security engineering capabilities.  There's no call for developer skills anywhere in the system, and where \"build\" capabilites are included, it's much more focused on enterprise IT capabilities.  That's no bad thing given how little security thinking goes into end user device builds and development these days, but the lack of development capability suggests that for digital services there is no concerted thinking about who is building the security of the platforms of the future.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue from my perspective is that the career pathways outlined make it doubly clear that there is no expectation that security advisors, policy people or CISO's are really expected to have any technical background at all.  In 2020, the lack of basic technological understanding is what will kill a CISO dead in the water.  You'll be unable to vet your suppliers, ask the right questions or make prioritisation decisions if you don't, at least, have. grounding in the modern digital technology era.  I'm not expecting every policy person to have once been a red teamer, but it would be nice if they understood what a browser was, what TLS actually meant, and how users interact with this technology.\r\n\r\nThere's quite a lot of interesting stuff in here, and if you skip through the first 270 pages or so, there's a fascinating section on skills that covers what skills are needed at different levels, and some examples of courses and training that are appropriate for developing those skills.  This suffers from, despite being a 350 page document, just not being exhaustive enough.  \"Secure development\" is the sole skill around development and security, which is far too broad brush for an area that could cover everything from secure coding guidelines to dependency checking to static analysis and beyond.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you are building a recruitment and retention framework, you could go a lot worse than using this as a starter.  [There's a NIST equivalent (NIST-SP-800-181)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-181.pdf) and I think this is far more usable than that was when it was first released (and probably still today, that NIST framework is super dry!).  But I wouldn't say that this is complete, you are going to need to define your organisational delivery capabilities around this, and determine what's missing, what areas you want in addition, and then build your own framework on top of it.",

Don't just dump data on them and ask them to \"find interesting things\", come up with potential attack scenarios, and ask how they'd detect them (database exports being triggered), and then find out what data you need to collect to feed that collection system.  That way you won't end up \"collecting everything\", but only collecting a baseline of interesting stuff (sysmon logs from EUDs for example), along with data that your analysts say they need.",

What this report says, in essence, is that increased divisiveness is a natural artefact of massively increased access to information.  That (US based) people cannot cope with the sheer amount of information that affects elections, and so they tend to ignore information about common policies and devote attention to policies that they have extreme reactions to, either for or against.\r\n\r\nThis to me points at a failure of the media as a regulator on this kind of behaviour.  Media companies are supposed to exist in order to level access to information, promoting a wider spread of views and reducing the information asymmetry that exists.  However, the commercial incentives on many US based media organisations means that they have commercial pushes to \"align with their audience\" that means that they do not in fact regulate that news.  A clickbait article that makes people more impassioned will generate more views, which generates more advertising revenue.  Even in organisations that try to create an ethical wall between commercial and editorial decisions, the editorial decisions are still driven by a desire for traffic as part of the brand competing, but also for ego for the journalists and editors.  One of the reason that I suspect that this is reduced in the UK is the existence of the BBC as \"an impartial voice\", which does exist to at least attempt balance in these areas. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of this is a reminder of how important state driven news that is independent of the government driven agenda probably is to a well functioning democracy.",

Basically, the hackers broke into a telephone network and subverted its built-in wiretapping features for their own purposes. That could have been done with any phone account, not just cellular ones. Nevertheless, there are some elements of the Vodafone Greece system that were unique and crucial to the way the crime was pulled off.\r\n\r\nWe still don\u2019t know who committed this crime. A big reason is that the UK-based Vodafone Group, one of the largest cellular providers in the world, bobbled its handling of some key log files.

I replied with [\"Security says no\"](https://twitter.com/bruntonspall/status/1232574851149332481?s=20), and a reply \"Who is security\" caused me to reply with \"we're all security\".\r\n\r\nBut this got me thinking, who actually is security really?  The Government Security Profession is part of the UK Governments plan to create government wide functions.  The idea being that instead of feeling like an employee of Department for Work and Pensions, or the Cabinet Office, you might also feel like part of a wider cross government function, so you are part of the \"security profession\".\r\n\r\nBut security as a profession is an incredibly broad area.  Government security profession details 4 main areas, Physical, Personnel, Cyber and Technical security.  The implication is that I should be able to get on just as well with someone who worries about bollards on a daily basis as with a vetting officer, or a red teamer.  But even this narrow definition misses out the oft-confused adjunct professions around information security (Did you leave a confidential paper on a train?) and risk management (No, you can't do that), all of which are grouped into \"security\" as a whole.  Add to that the fact that even cyber security is changing, the days of the security team being the ones who set firewall rules or lock down end user devices are going and instead they are being asked to build platforms and tools and systems for delivering security at speed and scale.\r\n\r\nThis makes recruiting into a security team a nightmare, because you have no idea when you look at a job advert whether it's actually talking about the same kind of security that you think of.  We often fail to articulate what the mission of security is, and that's one of the reasons that we cannot engage our senior leaders or board members to care about us.  The only way seems to be to shout from the rooftops about \"advanced persistent threats\" and use scare tactics to get money and attention.  \r\n\r\nIf we as a profession could clearly and well articulate our mission, our goals, we'd be able to tell potential recruits and exciting story about how they can make a difference, and we'd be able to get money from our leaders.  I'm still going through the AppSec Cali conference talks, but the interesting thing to me is that there are a few companies doing lots of stuff in this area, Netflix, Twillio, Salesforce, Dropbox, and all of them had talks about how they went about building something, whether a platform, tool or program, that improved the security posture of their organisation.  These are projects and programs that have a goal, a mission, a vision and a level of excitement around them.  They're providing risk reduction, they're reducing the harm of legacy decisions, but that's not the articulated goal, and thats far more exciting and attractive to everyone involved.",

He was certain \"Jessica\" was not real, pointing, like others, to the earring. The AI system, he said, \"hasn't seen enough jewelry to learn it properly.\"\r\n\r\nBut he also cautioned that fake faces like \"Jessica\" may just be a small sign of what's to come.\r\n\r\n\"Faces are just the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"Eventually the underlying technology can synthesize coherent text, voices of loved ones, and even video. Those social media companies that have AI researchers should allocate some time and research funds into this ever growing problem.\"",

(This is actually a problem itself sometimes as people over-egg this, and you can end up wasting a lot of time/money trying to defend against an adversary who has no interest in you, or won't deploy their full capability against you and might stick to commodity tools.)\r\n\r\nJournalism, particularly in the midst of investigative work into in the actions or inactions of a government, poses some interesting personal security challenges. One of my reactions was \"well, yes, obviously\" to the use of 'trip' or burner equipment however this can be easier said than done as journalists are likely to want to maintain their same contact details (so trip numbers and trip emails are hard to work with - [like I've blogged about before](https://medium.com/@joelgsamuel/being-safe-on-hostile-wifi-or-mobile-networks-7f9b045d3b98)) so I would look to the use of logical persistent services (VoIP applications etc) rather than rely on a telecoms provider to associate a number to a SIM card.\r\n\r\nThere are various debates about whether open source makes things more secure or not. The 'jump' made here (as far as I understand the phrasing) is that _because_ Signal's app is open source, \"breaches\" _will_ be immediately known. This makes a whole bunch of problematic assumptions about how issues are reported to open source projects and the authoritative and singular nature of code repositories (that there are no other ones that you cannot see). Further, open source or not, authors should control how they address issues: you don't really want to alert people of the exact issue before the fix is available (which is what a public pull request with a bunch of code to fix a problem would probably do).\r\n\r\n(Michael). I'm really torn on this article.  I really like the security pragmatism that is throughout this.  I especially like the identification that different state level threats will use different tactics, along with the fact that most of these attacks are just the same low level attacks that competent cyber crime operators conduct, from phishing to attacking default credentials.  Where the state level of capability is applied, it was more with a physical presence, which is something that states have a huge power to do within their own borders.\r\n\r\nHowever, as interesting as it is to get data points on these attacks, many of the purported attacks in this article are inconclusive or happenstance.  They do not have the rigour applied to them, or they combine sentences in such a way as to sound scary but don't hold up to analysis.  For example, the Russia office having a default username/password combination is a vulnerability.   It's not evidence of a breach or of any attack.  If the author had said that they were attacked through this, then there's something more to say, but they don't.  Additionally, knowing that the FSB office overlooks the building is of no relevance to a cyber based attack on a default username and password.  Your office could be half way around the world, have the default credentials and you could be attacked by the FSB.\r\n\r\nAs a threat brief for journalists however, this works to remind them that they are often considered valid targets around the world by governments who really want to know what they are writing about.  It should remind us that Governments do have technical and physical capabilities and are willing to deploy them.  The complication here is that this doesn't really give you any actions you can take to defend yourself.",

If the underlying thinking doesn\u2019t change, changing the words/terms has no consequence, because the people who see employees as a liability will happily call them resources and still continue having dismissive models in mind. And if managers do not see the value of working with people, making them use a different term mainly spurs resentment.

That also explains all the comments and analysis helpfully provided by [Joel](https://joelgsamuel.com/) this week.  Thanks Joel.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of discussion around data going around at the moment.  The UK leaving the European Union leaves the UK in an interesting position with regard to data privacy.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) is considered the strongest protection of personal data that exists around the world at the moment, and the UK can now potentially deviate from that standard to a lower standard of protection should it choose to.  However it has already enacted a recent update to the Data Protection Act which binds the laws of the country to meet the standards of the GDPR, and so it would require modifications to that act to pass parliament to deliberately loosen data protection.  This might sound like madness, but loosening of regulations happens all the time.  The acts are often passed as \"red tape reduction\" style acts and so can be very popular within certain political circles.\r\n\r\nBut data is such a broad term that it's difficult to even know what we are talking about half of the time.  Amazon as a company keeps records on you and how you interact with their services. Is that personal data about you, or is it product development data about their product usage?  As someone directly involved in service design and development, I often find myself saying \"Can we see how users actually use this thing and then make a decision?\".  A recent example was to do with setting session timeouts.  We don't know what the right number is in some cases, because the sign in process in some government systems can be user unfriendly.  We don't want to timeout someone who has taken a break to make dinner for their kids, or who started it at work one evening and will resume it the next morning, but we also don't want an excessively long opportunity for an attacker to get into their system and steal or modify their data.\r\n\r\nI found myself asking questions like \"How many people start a session and finish the same day?\", \"How many people start a session on one computer and then resume the session on a phone or other computer?\", \"How many users drop out when we ask them to sign back in?\".  In order to answer these questions, we need to gather data on users, on how they use the service we are building and how they interact with it.  That also means trying to personally identify them so that we can tell if they switch from their desktop to a phone at key points in the process.  \r\n\r\nBut as an end user, I might feel worried that a government department is keeping track of how I apply to a given service.  If that service is sensitive, I might not want to be identified.  I might be concerned that I'll get adverts relating to that service in my normal browsing, which coworkers or my partner might see.  I might also have concerns that the Government might combine that data with other government services to \"combat fraud\" which might reveal interesting combinations of service use.\r\n\r\nOur data concerns as individuals are often far in excess of my experience of actual data analytics, that the laws, like GDPR, try to prevent the sort of advanced data processing that companies wish they could do, when in reality they have a bad spreadsheet run by Ron who still hasn't worked out how VLOOKUP works.  I'm not saying that Amazon or Google or other companies aren't actively mining the data they get from us, or that they should be allowed to, but I do think that we tend to get a little bit \"chicken little\" about the worries of data protection sometimes.\r\n\r\nYes, there are reasons to be concerned with whether we are doing enough about data protection.  Yes, it's right that we ask questions about whether the data collection is necessary, important and compliant with law.  But it's also OK that product and service teams want to collect data to make better products.  Whether that be to understand how users actually use their service, or to make recommendation engines that don't assume that because I once bought a toilet seat, that I want to buy one everytime I shop online.",

Secondly it\u2019s a look at how the US views both it\u2019s adversaries and it\u2019s erstwhile international allies. Finally it\u2019s interesting in its timing and provenance. \r\n\r\nLooking at the first two, this is a great story of an intelligence coup. This enabled the US to decrypt supposedly \u201cmilitary grade security\u201d used by nations and military juntas around the world for decades. \r\n\r\nIf you read between the lines, it looks like the CIA didn\u2019t actually interfere with the machines too much. There was too much chance of that being discovered. Instead it really had an impact on the training manuals. Telling people to use the devices improperly would ensure that the security was much reduced. \r\n\r\nThis also means that the big targets, Russia, China for example, were probably not targets of this. It was aimed at much smaller actors who didn\u2019t build and manage their own equipment and training. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more interesting to me is that the Washington Post and ZDF have been clearly given unredacted access to the source documents. There must be a reason that they want this to be in the news. While Crypto AG shut down a few years ago, this indicates a trend. The US believes that it is acceptable to interfere with such equipment and sell it oversees, and that it won\u2019t mind if that equipment is used by UN members, European countries or other western allies. Are they sending a signal to China about Huawei or is there some other reason this was briefed?",

After we found this, we wanted to find out the reason why this was happening, in Skyscanner we have custom docker images for each of our most used languages (Python, Java, Node and now Go as well), those images have been created in collaboration with Security so they follow all our standards (not running as root is one of them), but in some special cases teams need to use a different base image or language, and the base images available online don\u2019t usually set up a user and end up running as root.

            "intro": "If you've never seen a risk matrix, then the idea of talking about risks being unlikely, rare, likely and contrasting that with the impact of the risk might seem unusual to you.  Here is [a sample risk matrix](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Risk-rating-matrix-Impact-probability-matrix_fig1_332424825) to help with the below\r\n\r\nBut it's likely that you've seen something that describes risks in this way.  \"This has a very low chance of happening, and a medium impact, so this is a low risk\".  I've written lots of statements myself as part of risk assessments, and one of the odd parts of the whole process is the determination of how likely the risk actually is.\r\n\r\nThe thing with those risk matrices, is that they are qualitative rather than quantitive.  People describe likelihoods as very low, low, medium, high and very high.  It's easy for someone to turn those into numbers, say 1 to 5, and then perform maths on it, but this leads to some weird behaviours.  In theory a very low likelihood risk, (1), with a very high impact (5) might have a total risk score (5x1 = 5) that is the same as a very high likelihood risk (5) and a very low impact risk (1) (Total risk score 1x5 = 5).  But if you move either of the very lows up by one, the risk total would jump to 10 (2x5 or 5x2).  This quantised score gives an impression of being a sliding scale (saying oh, that risk is a 16 out of 25), but in reality because of the multiplication, there are only certain notches that a risk total can be.  For those interested, in a 5x5 matrix, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 25... which is a weird frequency distribution.\r\n\r\nBut worse than that, I've found myself struggling with the lack of willingness to ascribe certainty in the model.  One entertaining risk statement I read in someone elses risk assessment included the likelihood and impact of a cleaner or janitor in AWS's data center using their access to get hold of a physical disk drive.  The likelihood was marked as Very Low, which is good, but I wanted to know why there wasn't a \"Never\" option.  It boils down to whether you think there is even an infinitesimal chance that this event can happen.  Risk managers can be told all about how physical access is carefully monitored.  About metal scanners on the doors to ensure that nothing is smuggled out, but often they are unwilling to ever say that there is absolutely no chance that this will happen.  \r\n\r\nHowever, with our graded structure, as you can see from the sample risk matrix, if the impact is very high, then even a very low likelihood risk is going to come out as a medium risk in our assessment.  I've seen many a Government service with a policy that all medium risks need to be addressed before the service can go live.\r\n\r\nIn our example of physical access, we might talk about using on-disk encryption, which has a performance impact on the servers, or we might try to insist on our own special controls on the hosting provider (good luck with that).\r\n\r\nAll of this is why I struggle with risk management as practiced at many organisations today.  The reality of risks that are well below a certain likelihood threshold is just not included.  And mostly that's because risk advisors don't want to be the one who said a risk was so unlikely not to bother, and then find out later that they were wrong.  I don't know how we fix it, but it's worth remembering next time someone starts talking about risks in that manner.  Because if you dig a little bit, you'll almost certainly find that there's some pseudoscience behind it that isn't being presented to you.  Give that stuff a look and ask yourself whether the likelihood and impact scores are really what you think they are.",

Analyzing the configuration of the different samples made us realize the C2 domains were identical across all samples. The team was able to sinkhole multiple REvil C2 domains1. The REvil C2 traffic is unidirectional and solely used for statistics. Piggybacking the C2 we can gain insight into the statistical data.\r\n\r\nThe affiliates using the REvil ransomware as a service (RaaS) are skilled and adapting their approach to the victim\u2019s organization. We assume the attacks are often not targeted but more opportunity based. Access that is gained in some way is later escalated in order to take over an entire network.

Is someone going to take over the secretary of states account?  Attackers want to read the obituary that the newspaper wrote.  Attackers *must* know we process billions in payments, and want to steal it.\r\n\r\nIf we look at Travelex for example, with all the good guesses pointing at them being significantly hit by REvil or one of its contemporaries.  If that criminal gang had access to the entire internal systems of a major financial system, then they probably had the ability to create orders for money, turning them into a giant ATM for the criminals to withdraw money.  \r\n\r\nIf you were an attacker looking for that kind of thing, someone like Travelex is exactly who you would look for.  But in reality, it looks like the attackers didn't really know what they had got.  All they wanted was execution rights on as many computers as possible so they could encrypt them and ransom them.\r\n\r\nRisk management often takes entirely the wrong approach in this area.  We start with our data, with what makes us special and then assume that attackers want to get at it.  There is a better way.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen that the NCSC's new measures for understanding the impact of high risk vendors in telecoms uses attack trees as a risk assessment and control methodology.\r\n\r\nAttack trees help us to model our system based on  the sorts of goals that attackers might have, and then apply attacker profiles against the tree to determine the  most likely route that they will take to achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, in my experience, building attack trees tends to show you that if you have simple vulnerabilities, that almost all attackers, regardless of how much they care about your specific special data, will use them and therefore pose the greatest risk.\r\n\r\nEven if you think you are special, most attackers don't think you are special, you are simply the next line in their list of targets, and if you are not vulnerable to basic attacks, they'll mostly just move on.\r\n",

However, at Microsoft we believe that \"we have to treat privacy as a human right. We have to have end-to-end cybersecurity built into technology.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe also believe Windows adoption of encrypted DNS will help make the overall Internet ecosystem healthier. There is an assumption by many that DNS encryption requires DNS centralization. This is only true if encrypted DNS adoption isn\u2019t universal. To keep the DNS decentralized, it will be important for client operating systems (such as Windows) and Internet service providers alike to widely adopt encrypted DNS.\r\n\r\nBased on these principles, we are making plans to adopt DNS over HTTPS (or DoH) in the Windows DNS client. As a platform, Windows Core Networking seeks to enable users to use whatever protocols they need, so we\u2019re open to having other options such as DNS over TLS (DoT) in the future. For now, we're prioritizing DoH support as the most likely to provide immediate value to everyone. For example, DoH allows us to reuse our existing HTTPS infrastructure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor our first milestone, we'll start with a simple change: use DoH for DNS servers Windows is already configured to use. There are now several public DNS servers that support DoH, and if a Windows user or device admin configures one of them today, Windows will just use classic DNS (without encryption) to that server. However, since these servers and their DoH configurations are well known, Windows can automatically upgrade to DoH while using the same server",

I think there's pretty compelling evidence that NSO group sells its software to a large number of intelligence and policing authorities around the world, including ones that don't have the same western moral codes as the major western nations.  The citizen lab investigation and others shows that some of the governments who have access to this software will use it in ways that we would personally disagree with.  But that doesn't make the tool bad.  We could spend the money in R&D to build the same set of exploits within our intelligence arms (and quite probably do), but those would be unlikely to be used outside of offensive cyber operations, such as in policing like this.  It's far better to buy a capability if it exists than to build your own.\r\n\r\nWas the messaging from WhatsApp damaging to criminal investigations?  Of course it was, but was it WhatsApps right to tell their affected customers that they may have been hacked?  I think they were in the right.

An investigation needs to know that its tools aren't infallible and they might lose access at any time.  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, WhatsApp cannot tell the difference between a lawfully approved operation and an illegal hacking attempt, so they provided the best risk mitigation that they could for their users, they informed them that there was a risk they had been hacked by an unknown advanced party.

They had received a tip he was part of a group plotting an attack around Christmas. Once they saw the suspect\u2019s phone receive WhatsApp\u2019s alert, the phone went dark, the official said. The sleuths soon lost access to the suspect\u2019s messages, the official said, indicating he had discarded or disabled the phone.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe only had that one phone,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe put all our efforts into using this product to see what he was doing, which mosque he was going to, who was talking to him, whether the group was spread in neighboring countries.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe interception of data from the suspect\u2019s phone had gone on for just a few days before WhatsApp alerted the target. This meant the monitoring period had been too short to glean details of the suspected plot, the official said. The suspect had left his phone at home when he went out and was sending only brief messages, making investigators\u2019 work more difficult.\r\n\r\nThen WhatsApp sent its message: \u201cAn advanced cyber actor exploited our video calling to install malware on user devices. There\u2019s a possibility this phone number was impacted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatsApp killed the operation,\u201d the official said. The terror suspect is still under traditional surveillance. But human resources are spread thin, the official said, especially around the winter holidays, which in Europe extend into early January and are a time when terrorists have staged attacks on the continent. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only suspect we have to follow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe European official said NSO spyware had enabled his team to learn details of a separate gang of violent bank robbers and weapons traffickers and have police arrest them as they were about to commit a crime. In that case, they got lucky, the official said: \u201cOne gang member\u2019s phone we had infiltrated was already in police custody when the WhatsApp message landed.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe official said counterparts in other Western European countries told him more than 10 of their investigations may have been compromised by the WhatsApp alert. \u201cI talked about it with my colleagues,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey also couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. It affected them more because they used this WhatsApp tool more than we did.\u201d The former security official, from a different nation in Western Europe, said several countries there rely on NSO spyware in counterterrorism investigations.",

            "intro": "\"Security is important, you must patch now\".\r\n\r\nWe say this an awful lot in security.  I say this a lot!  Patching is probably the number 1 security control that you can apply.  Almost all cyber attacks from outside exploit known vulnerabilities that could have been patched and 0-day attacks are still quite rare.  If you can only do one thing, patching those critical security bugs is it.\r\n\r\nBut I've talked before about the technical complexity of patching your systems, of coordinating those change programs and getting everything tested and rolled out.  It isn't easy to actually carry out.  It's simple, but not easy.  But I've never really talked about the psychological impact of change and the inertia against change that we have in our lives.\r\n\r\nPeople get into routines in life.  I like to know that I get a cup of coffee in the morning, and I tend to sit in the same place on the same train most days.  Change is psychologically difficult for us as humans.  When things are similar or the same, we don't have to exert as much brainpower to assess the environment, ensure it is safe, and determine how to complete whatever actions we are trying to do.  But when things change, we get a spike of anxiety, our brain goes into alert and we need to reassess our environment to be sure that it is safe.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of our working environments.  One of the biggest issues that agile software delivery teams have to face is that their users often don't like it when things on the website or service they use moves around too much.  Any given change initiative will have people who dislike it respond straight away.  When I worked at the Guardian on the new CMS, everytime we launched a new section, we would be [inundated with comments from people who hated the new design](https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2014/dec/09/-sp-a-new-look-for-sport). \"I prefered the old design, I knew where to go to get my [crossword/football results/contributor I like]\".\r\n\r\nWhen we introduce change, such as bringing in DevOps to a team that doesn't work that way, or defining new security policies, or using agile, we often have to consider how to introduce that change.  It's counter-productive to turn up and just yell at people that they are dinosaurs who \"don't understand the modern way of working\" if they don't like it.  Good agile coaches and transformation experts understand this.  They talk about taking people on a journey, and building bridges to reach out to people.  As is linked below, when we talk about DevOps, it's vital to still recognise the value of what comes before.  If we can couch our concepts with the same language that was used before, then we are minimising that change that people need to adjust to.\r\n\r\nBut what about security patches and updates?  How does that apply?  When it comes to deploying patches and updates, we need to make sure that our customers are incentivised to apply them.  Will it make changes to our system?  Will it mean retraining our staff?  What could go wrong?  When we are talking about minor changes, we tend to think this doesn't matter.  And it's true, the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 is a much bigger change for people to adopt than fixing their Citrix VPN.  But people get burnt by big changes and become afraid of applying the little changes as well.\r\n\r\nWe need to remember that just telling people to patch, to adopt a new security approach, to do agile, we are deliberately putting people into an uncomfortable headspace.  We need to provide people reassurance about what that means, provide them contextual clues to help them orient themselves, and we need to have empathy for the stress that we put them under.",

But ICO decision notices and penalty notices are always quite interesting, especially for a firm of this size.\r\nIf sentences like \"malware installed on 5390 Point of Sale terminals\", \"attackers gained control of multiple domain administrator accounts\", \"significant SQL database reconnaissance and data theft\", \"POS devices not segregated from the corporate network\", \"did not have an effective system of logging and monitoring\", \"the vulnerability remained exploitable for four years\" and wonderfully \"running versions of java many years out of date (eight years)\" don't pique your fancy, let me give you an overview.\r\n\r\nDixons Store Groups runs Currys PCWorld as well as Dixons Travel.  That's somewhere a little over 500 retail locations in the UK (around 500 for Currys PC World and about 15 for Dixons Travel). In May 2017, they had a penetration test that said that their systems were \"susceptible to critical vulnerabilities\".  The pen test even raised that they thought that the point of sale terminals may not be compliant with PCI DSS which is quite alarming.\r\n\r\nThey suffered a breach sometime before the 24th July 2017.  We don't actually know when the breach was, but it seems that on the 24th July, the attackers installed malware onto some 5,390 point of sale terminals, the cash registers.  This malware was able to collect payment card details from the credit card scanners .  They say that over 5.6m credit card payment cards were affected by the breach.  Now because of the way chip and pin works, the attackers only really got the card number (the PAN) and the expiry date.\r\nHowever, they also had access to internal servers.  There are no records that actually record what the attackers did, because there isn't sufficient logging, but DSG's worst case scenario is that they had access to the non financial information such as name, address, phone numbers, date of birth and failed credit checks.  They later increased the number of affected systems to cover 14 million people's data.\r\n\r\nThere's load more details in here, the systems weren't patched and basic security controls weren't in place, primarily because DSG maintain, they had good external perimeter firewalls and therefore didn't need to turn on local firewalls on the devices.  There's definitely a case that says that given the attackers had domain admin accounts, they could probably disable or get around any controls they needed to.  But that's not the point.  The point of defence in depth is that you make the attacker work hard for each thing they have to get.\r\n\r\nIf this had been a month later, this would have fallen under GDPR.  The ICO gave DSG the highest fine they were legally allowed to give, and I suspect that under GDPR, they would have given them an even more significant fine.  This is the second find for Dixon Store Groups, as they also own Carphone Warehouse which was fined \u00a3400,000 last year for a similar style technical breach.  \r\n\r\nOne minor, interesting point.  5.6m credit cards sounds really quite low spread across 5000 terminals over a year.  That is only around a thousand transactions per terminal, or around 4ish per day.  It's easy to read this as the main till system for PC World, but if it is, either the attackers didn't take every transaction, or there's something up with the numbers somewhere.",

To actually abuse this, you need to find a single place to add your signed file, where the addition of your file wont raise eyebrows.

            "intro": "Last week I deliberately avoided talking about the Iran/USA international issues because I felt like there was not enough real information and too much misinformation floating around and I didn't want to add to it.  I meant to be explicit about it, and forgot while writing the introduction.  I'm still going to avoid talking directly to the ongoing conflict. There are many better news sources on foreign affairs who are far more qualified than me to talk about that stuff.\r\n\r\nI tend to avoid commenting on live issues at that level because international relations are far more complex than most people think.  While we talk about nations like Iran and the US as if they are a single thing, in reality there are politically elected governments, the political bodies such as parliaments, congress etc, as well as government services such as departments for trade and state and foreign affairs.  When we say \"The US wants to do X\", we are often shortcutting the context that matters to define who in the nation actually wants to do a thing.\r\n\r\nWithin nation state cyber affairs, this is true as well.  It's easy to kind of think that a Nation's leader just kind of says \"cyber-attack country X\" and the nation somehow goes off and does it.  In reality life is likely to be far more complicated.\r\n\r\nFirstly, nations need to build up capability in these areas.  They need to build or buy \"weapons\", or exploits.  But unlike traditional militaries who can maintain some of their equipment for decades, exploits have a very short half life.  Since the teams won't know when they need to use them, this means they need some way of rebuilding this stockpile constantly, and maintaining it.  The nation needs to build capability not just at the pointy end, in exploits, but also in command and control infrastructure, supply chains, research and development and of course personnel with the skills to use the tools.\r\n\r\nThen you need some form of reconnaissance and targeting process.  Nations are bound by all kinds of military restrictions on what are valid targets during a military conflict.  You aren't allowed to just randomly bomb companies or civilians.  Because of the deniability of many cyber attacks, this process is far less regulated at the moment than it should be, but still, nations need to make priority decisions.  Should they target military systems?  Government systems? Critical national infrastructure? This targeting requires information on who those companies are, what sorts of computer systems they run and who works there.\r\n\r\nThe point of all of this is that actually building this capability and deciding to unleash it is a major effort on the part of a nation.  Building these capabilities so they are ready to use has been a priority for many nations over the last decade, and the reason that we talk about the same countries all the time when we talk about nation state actors is because those are the most advanced nations in the world at the moment. \r\n\r\nBut critically, if there was a surge in attacks from Iran to US or UK based targets, then those targets had been painted months ago.  You are really unlikely to be at any increased risk now than you were a few months ago.  In all out cyberwar, we'll most likely see a set of surgical cyber strikes against existing military targets, disabling and confusing the military command and control structure and enabling traditional military capabilities to carry out their jobs with lowered resistance.\r\n\r\nIn reality, is this what cyberwar looks like?  If it happens it will.  But cyber offensive capabilities are far more commonly being used as a form of diplomatic soft power, the so called Grey Zone of \"diplomatic space between peace and war\".  \r\n\r\nThis is the area where you want to conduct activities that send a strong message, but do not cause the breakout of war.  These are the actions, such as diplomatic sanctions, snubbing of leaders, disputes over territory, economic influence, and spells of aggressive actions followed by a period of calm designed to prevent the breakout of all out hostilities.  Cyber capabilities are a strong grey zone capability, and the sort of thing that we are far more likely to see in the cyber domain.\r\n\r\nThe thing with grey zone activities, is that because they take energy and effort, if outright conflict breaks out, the focus for a nation's command and control switches to the full on military capabilities and targets.  Modern nations have a doctrine of hybrid warfare or fusion warfare, in which a nation can exert pressure through all of the controls, but the aims and targets of those capabilities get much more focused in that situation.\r\n\r\nIn essence, what I think I'm saying is that the breakout of hostilities internationally, is very unlikely to be accompanied by DDOS attacks and defacements on civil service websites and digital services, or ransomware breakouts on major international companies.  All of the endless news reports about how many thousands of port scan attempts are happening from Iranian IP addresses are people over-reacting and misunderstanding what this stuff actually looks like.  Instead we would see the nations cyber capabilities pointed very specifically at the targets as driven by the conflict.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, two major VPN providers have significant CVE's out, and if you run either the Pulse Secure VPN or the Citrix VPN, you should patch, because those protections against amateurs running Kali will also protect you against many nation state attackers, as well as ransomware operators.",

Several weeks of conferences really can take it out of you it turns out.\r\n\r\nOne of things that I've noticed over the last few years of writing this newsletter is just how poorly the incentives work for many cybersecurity companies.  If you build malware detection tools, and find malware, find the command and control infrastructure, you would be commercially worse off if you take down the C2 infrastructure, because people using your tools are protected, but the ones being infected are the potential customers you might be able to sell your tools to.\r\n\r\nOf course, further to this, it's entirely unclear who actually should be taking down this infrastructure when it is found.  If it's all inside a single country, one can look at existing policing efforts, although most internal police forces are not computer aware enough to actually deal with cybercrime in that way.  But worse, because of the global nature of the internet, almost all of this stuff ends up crossing national borders.  Should government agencies be the ones responsible?  If so which agencies?  Is it policing? intelligence and security?  national security? \r\n\r\nThis lack of good incentives to actually clean up the mess means that it is easy for criminals to operate at large across the world.  Providing they are careful to not annoy the local police forces, and not big enough to draw attention of the international policing efforts they can continue as they wish.  Until we can sort out these elements and provide strong industry and government interventions, we'll still see the creation and distribution of ransomware, phishing and other attack vectors to be highly profitable and generally low risk for many criminals out there.",

            "intro": "You often here security researchers talk about \u201cThat\u2019s not in my threat model\u201d, \u201cThis is secure only for a certain threat model\u201d, or [\u201cthe lock is invincible to the people who do not have a screwdriver\u201d](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/15/taplock_broken_screwdriver/) , but most of us don\u2019t really know what a threat model is, and our users certainly don\u2019t.\r\n\r\nWe tend to assume or build threat models in our heads when we talk about security, and we do so based on our context, our experience, and our assumptions.  But since we never communicate them, we can find ourselves talking at odds with other security professionals because we have different assumed threat models.\r\n\r\nOne of my sons recently told me that his bike lock was not secure, because \u201cI\u2019d just try 0000 and then 0001 and then 0002 and soon it would be unlocked\u201d.  Since he is young and enjoys maths, I set him the challenge to find out how long it would take to try all 10000 combinations if each try took 2 seconds.  We got the result of around 5-6 hours with a bit of mental math, and then discussed how likely it was that someone would sit and try for 5 hours to unlock his bike and steal it.  (Subnote: search time is actually n/2 on average, so only 2.5 hours, and by trying common combinations early, could be much faster.  My 8 year old didn\u2019t really need the details yet though)\r\n\r\nThis is really all threat models are really about, who wants to do a bad thing, what bad thing do they want to do and how might they go about it.  There are lots of different models we can use to do this, and they most come in the form of questions that we can ask ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe Practical PenTest Labs discussion online this week about them storing passwords in plaintext in the database but generating passwords for users was a perfect example of people with very different threat models approaching a problem.\r\n\r\nIf you assume that the biggest threat to your service is hackers who want to take credentials from existing data breaches and use them against your service, then generating passwords looks sensible.  It\u2019s a perfectly logical and defensible approach to that threat. \r\nHowever, the requirement to remind people of their password, meaning storing the passwords in some reversible encrypted form (in essence plaintext) means that there is now a new threat model.  As an attacker, if I can get access to the database, I get access to every single users account, because the username and passwords are enumerable and usable.\r\n\r\nIn similar experiences, I hear people constantly worry about nation state level attacks.  What if the Chinese target this, what if the NSA target that?  We struggle to enumerate whether these threat models are realistic (how interesting actually are you to a nation state) and we ignore that they have a restricted budget and energy to receive their goals.\r\n\r\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, there is no standard for threat modelling, making it very hard for us to actually communicate with people about what threat model we had in mind when we made security decisions.  There are a number of neat tools for performing threat models on \u201csystems\u201d, but they are often low level computer and interaction focused, rather than human interaction focused, making them cumbersome and unwieldy for a lot of the sorts of conversations I see around this stuff.\r\n\r\nAt it\u2019s most basic, I encourage you to consider the threat model next time you consider a security thing.  How much effort is a sim swapping attack to carry out to get access to your email?  Who wants to do that, and are they really interested in you specifically, or people like you?  What would make them move on to someone else?  The simplest way to approach it is just to ask \u201cwho? what? how?\u201d  Who is the attacker?  What do they want? How will they get it?",

Brisbane](https://yowconference.com/brisbane/) conference, and I've therefore been enjoying the sun and heat.\r\n\r\nThe subject of my talks is really about where security is going.  I repeat the theme that the best practices of the previous generation of architectures are not necessarily the best practices of the next generation of architectures.  That instead we have emerging new practices that sometimes disagree with what we call \"best practice\".\r\n\r\nA good example of this is the way that password best practice has changed over time.  Back when we had just one computer, one password, and it required physical access to get to it, our typical passwords worked against our threat model.  But as the context changed, and we had hundreds of passwords, each with complexity requirements, the humble password no longer works for the threat model of today.  But we continue to fight the battles from before using the weapons of the previous generation, creating increasingly difficult complexity requirements and so on.\r\n\r\nA modern security team might not follow the best practices of yesteryear.  They might not be separate to engineering, they might report to the CTO for example, because they spend more time building tools and don't want to be considered the auditors.  They might work in code rather than reading architecture diagrams and documents.\r\n\r\nWhen we say best practice we tend to mean agreed best practice which requires a depth of experience to know what practices are good, what works in pretty much all contexts and can be agreed.  But when we are doing new and novel things, the best practice will rarely work for us.  Instead we have to focus on the emerging practice, the practices done just by a few companies, by the newest and most innovative instead.\r\n\r\nBut we can't try to evolve and do every possible new practice at once, and we can't do that stuff when we struggle with the basics.  We need to pick the places where an emerging practice aligns with the value that we are looking for as an organisation and focus on the ones that give us the best benefits.",

Nevertheless, it is quite clear how they can be justified within their respective worldviews. China, seeking economic development and political stability, has combined a politically defensive stance with cyber activities serving to enhance economic capabilities and competitiveness with the United States. Russia, with its more limited economic interests and a greater influence of military and intelligence services, is applying its information security doctrines against external targets in order to effect political destabilization and paralysis.\r\n> Yet its preferred endgame is less clear than China\u2019s, and its chaos-based tactics more prone to escalation and unintended consequences.\r\n\r\nYou can see the differences in the aims of the countries and how those aims are achieved, but you can also see points of conflict in the Sinoa-Russian agreements, points that the west may be able to exert diplomatic effort to ensure that it doesn't just become \"us-vs-them\".",

It has a poor understanding or use of social media and instead focuses on trying to get contentious lines to be discussed or picked up in mainstream press.  This method of using a \"cut-out\" is classic spycraft applied to the modern era, and shouldn't really be a surprise to anyone.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is that while we can tell citizens to be more mindful of what they see and share on Facebook (and I think that's a lost cause anyway), it's really hard to tell people that they may not be able to trust the mainstream media that they read all the time because the journalists were fooled into covering a story.

One of the salient characteristics of this tactic is the need for a second party (such as Wikileaks, for example) to spread the results of a hack-and-leak operation, since it is not effective to leak hacked documents without having an audience. In this white paper we analyze the GRU\u2019s methods for disseminating the results of its hack-and-leak operations. While its attempts to do so through its own social media accounts were generally ineffective, it did have success in generating media attention (including on RT), which led in turn to wider coverage of the results of these operations. Fancy Bear\u2019s own Facebook posts about its hack-and-leak attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), for example, received relatively little engagement, but write-ups in Wired and The Guardian ensured that its operations got wider attention.\u00a0",

This is vital for ensuring that fraud can be tracked, that criminal theft of money can be discovered and reversed and to ensure that international regulations on money transfers can be adhered to.\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies were born out of a desire to have currencies that cannot be tracked, where the money can be sent from person A to person B without having to prove any real identity, just possession of the wallet.  This means that it's remarkably easy if you steal someones bitcoin, to run it through a mixer and get the money out without the original person having any comeback. \r\n\r\nThe same can be said about cash, but the interesting thing is that we very rarely make large purchases with cash, instead choosing to use either direct banking transfers (which are regulated and tracked) or in some cases bonded transfers via solicitors (which are regulated and tracked).\r\n\r\nWe've seen so many thefts of cryptocurrencies, whether from malware infested wallets, or sim hijacking to transfer online accounts, and we haven't yet built a model that is understandable, that works for normal people, and is appropriately secure for transferring large amounts of money.",

For example, a city can look as messy as an anthill. But really, it\u2019s a beautiful equilibrium that evolved to satisfy a thousand competing constraints: topology, weather, people\u2019s traditions, skills, wealth, preferences\u2026 Planners may make their maps look better when they use zoning to separate the city into business, residential, and commercial neighborhoods, but they also destroy a subtle, efficient balance. They forget that the only activity that goes on in any city is that of people living their lives, which requires all the activities above \u2014 preferably in close proximity. Splitting a city into residential, commercial and business zones is like throwing dough, cheese and pepperoni into the different compartments of a bento box and calling it a pizza.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nFinally: who is complaining about the chaos? If outsiders complain, but people living inside the system seem happy with it, it probably means that the chaos is serving them right, and that it\u2019s just foreign eyes who are unable to perceive its underlying order.\r\n\r\nThis is a special case of Chesterton\u2019s Fence, which states you should never take down a fence before knowing why it was put up.

IMDSv2 returns a secret token to the software running on the EC2 instance, which will use the token as a password to make requests to IMDSv2 for metadata and credentials. Unlike traditional passwords, you don\u2019t need to worry about getting the token to the software, because the software gets it for itself with the PUT request. The token is never stored by IMDSv2 and can never be retrieved by subsequent calls, so a session and its token are effectively destroyed when the process using the token terminates. There\u2019s no limit on the number of requests within a single session, and there\u2019s no limit on the number of IMDSv2 sessions.

Security people often assume that the system itself is working correctly, but that there are malicious humans who are trying to get around the correctly working system.  \r\n\r\nBut this fantasy idea that most systems are working is entirely that a fallacy.  System failure is all around us all of the time.  Most systems, whether technical or business process systems, have various safeguards in them that catch errors and retry silently.  This exceptional processes are often not document and are quite often entirely silent to those outside the system.  You can\u2019t see those failures occurring because the things you do measure are still moving in exactly the way they always have.\r\n\r\nSafety engineering and reliability engineering is predicated on the assumption that any part of the system could fail, and ensuring that we can handle that failure gracefully and recover for certain values of business continuity.  But in security and digital transformation, we tend to have far too much blind faith in the systems that we build.\r\n\r\nWhether it be the assumption that the messy chaotic real word system and process is a sign of inefficiency, or the assumption that there is a single root cause for a catastrophic failure, and that all of the individual failures are somehow special with the benefit of hindsight.  This assumption hurts us and makes systems less reliable, less likely to succeed and less secure.\r\n\r\nIf you have time you should watch [Who destroyed three mile island](https://youtu.be/1xQeXOz0Ncs) as a great introduction to this subject.",

There is of course some good that can come from this: checks and balances on human decisions, prompts due to automated correlation of symptoms and genetic dispositions etc, but there should be a fairly heavy amount of scepticism and ongoing monitoring in how the use of data changes over time and the consequences of these new automations (particularly the unseen).\r\n\r\n(Michael) The optics on this probably look far worse than the reality, maybe, in an optimists view of the world at least.

Articles and advice from people who should know better, that posit threats well outside most peoples concerns, and suggest that we should all worry about all of them, otherwise the sky will fall.\r\n\r\nFor some people, this is because they are selling amazing cyber-widgets that claim to block even [generation-V cyber attacks](https://www.checkpoint.com/gen-v-cyber-security/) (I don\u2019t know either), or because they profit when people are afraid.  But for many more people, it\u2019s because as an industry this is just the way that we work.\r\n\r\nFor example, SMS two-factor authentication defeats 100% of automated account takeover attacks, 99% of bulk phishing attacks and 2/3rds of highly targeted attacks [[source](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html)].\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a level of protection that far outstrips any other control on the market, any other control that I\u2019ve ever heard of.  Sure, that control will get less effective over time, but for almost every user out there, enabling SMS 2FA is better than not enabling it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s true that Sim swapping attacks are surprisingly easy, that when subject to one, someone can bypass all SMS 2FA that you have, and that TOTP authentications like Authy; Google Authenticator; or Microsoft Authenticator are not vulnerable to that same attack.  But spreading fear that SMS is not sufficiently secure doesn\u2019t help given that it is a technology that has 100% penetration among the approximate 5bn phones (of which only 3.2bn are smart phones).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a running joke in the UK government security circles for years now that security experts always respond to a question about whether a given thing is secure with \u201cit depends\u201d.  But the problem is that much of the time it really does depend.  Is SMS 2FA secure?  If you are trying to launch nuclear missiles, or [securing \u00a3680bn of daily transactions](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/payment-and-settlement-statistics) then no, it\u2019s not secure enough.  But security advice that starts it depends is often not consumable by individuals.  They don\u2019t possess the security awareness or understanding to determine their risk effectively, and so they just have to go on what security people put out into the world.  \r\n\r\nWe might think that the advice depends on the situation, but we should also be able to come up with advice that is accurate and useful to anyone, even if it\u2019s not entirely sufficient for everyone.  This advice makes a good security baseline, because in the absence of any other advice, the recipient will be more secure than if they just didn\u2019t take advice at all.\r\n\r\nIf we continue to spread cyber-nonsense that scares people, that makes them think that they cannot ever be secure from the elite nation state cyber hackers, then they just wont bother with anything.  But if we can give [clear simple actionable advice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/activate-two-factor-authentication-on-your-email), that works for most people, we can spend more of our time working with people who need the specialist advice.\r\n",

Sadly absolutely nobody does this, I don't do it, you don't do it, even [directors at GCHQ dont do it all the time](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/serious-side-pranking).  By telling people that this is what they should do, when they inevitably click the malware laden link and their machine does something weird, they are psychologically incentivised to not tell anyone, because they are conditioned to feel like they broke the rules, and people's first instinct when they break rules is to hide and hope they aren't caught.\r\n\r\nThis advice for security teams is exactly correct.

Given how much the classifiers flip-flop, if everytime it thought there was something ahead it might hit and applied the brakes, the car would constantly stop/start and the ride would be both uncomfortable, people wouldn't buy the car and the system would fail.\r\nThis system seems to give the system enough time to be really sure that the situation is as it judged.\r\n\r\nThat should ahve been the end of it, if the car had engaged the emergency braking, it might have prevented a tragedy, but now another interaction happens.  The system sounds an audible alarm to indicate that there's going to be an accident, and the operator grabs the wheel.  The system assumes that if an operator has hands on the wheel, then they are in control, and disengages all of the autopilot systems, stopping the braking plan.  Of course the human cannot react in under a second (although they come close) and they don't hit the brakes until after collision occurs.\r\n\r\nThe question we should ask ourselves is not \"why did this system fail?\" but \"why does this system work the rest of the time?\".  There's lots of interacting systems, and given the number of miles driven, it works in lots of other cases.\r\n\r\nIt's super easy to write a headline like \"Uber car wasn't programmed to see humans\" or talk about the Trolley Problem, but in reality, this is a chaotic mesh of different systems all interacting.

While I get as excited about advances and cool new toys as anyone else (ok, maybe a little more so), one of the problems we have in cybersecurity is the growing legacy of poor decisions and poor technology.\r\n\r\nI've said before that doing the basics is not easy, but is the most important thing you can do.  That's because so many of the more advanced things depend on the basics being done.  Threat Hunting may be cool and all, but if you don't fetch and store logs, there is nothing for your threat hunters to do.  A next generation SOC sounds amazing, but if you don't even know what your enterprise estate looks like, what servers you've got and no ability to make changes, then it's only just so many blinking lights.\r\n\r\nWe get very overawed by all of the new exciting things and want to apply them, and in many cases we should be using new and up to date tools.  But we need to ensure that we put in the effort to maintain the basic systems.  The [Red Queen Effect](https://fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/) tells us that everyone has to run just to keep up with their competitors.  As that article goes on to state, and many business guru's have made millions selling books like to say: It's about working smarter not harder. \r\n\r\nI mostly disagree, on the basis that this just changes the race into one of trying to be the one working smarter than all of the others.  The paperless office, video conferencing, telekits and remote presence are all \"work smarter\" ideas that haven't materially affected how businesses actually operate.  When was the last time you heard of a business trumpting that it beat it's rivals because it had better video conference facilities than it's competitors did.  \r\n\r\nWhat makes successful organisations are not the ones who you see on stage talking about the newest and best things, generally it's the ones that just quietly get one and do the thing, even if it's reasonably basic things that they do.  You won't get plaudits and applause for doing the basics well, but you will free up people to get on with the \"smart work\" that enables the organisation to be better and deliver better services/products to its users.",

Our results also demonstrate why this was the case. Low performers at the academy were less likely to attain advanced training, stuck at middling ranks, and faced a much higher risk of discharge. The resulting career pressure produced the incentive for underachievers to join the secret police. In addition, we find that the Argentine regime willingly exploited these career concerns and placed the most pressured agents in the most repressive unit within the secret police. Finally, we show that secret police service indeed paid off. Agents attained higher ranks and stayed longer in the security apparatus. These career boosting effects were most pronounced for agents with the lowest early career performance.\r\n\r\nTaken together, our study identifies mundane but universal career concerns as the prime motivation to engage in arduous secret police work. This has important implications. Career pressures serve as the lubricant of repressive machines in autocracies. Leaders can exploit these incentives to maximize bureaucratic compliance. Institutionalized, meritocratic bureaucracies therefore do not contradict autocratic longevity. Likewise, governments can accomplish swift autocratic turns without major bureaucratic resistance. Officials facing career pressures are likely to serve as willing executioners, while their well-placed peers remain silent bystanders.",

The reason is that contextual thinking is really hard for people to do, and it's far more likely to cause a mistake.\r\n\r\nCase in point, the actual threat model of electronic devices inside secure compartmented information facilities (SCIFs) is quite complicated.  There are concerns about malware getting in and out, about people smuggling data transfer devices, as well as classified TEMPEST and electromagnetic security concerns.  In reality, not every visitor, and not every device presents the same level of risk, and some facilities will allow certain devices in and out providing the risks are appropriately managed.  But it's far too complex to tell every visitor or staff member what all hte rules are, and in some cases, you might not even be allowed to tell some people what the rules are because it would reveal the capabilities that the intelligence agencies possess.  \r\n\r\nInstead we set rules that just say \"No electronic devices past this point\", and then instruct the guards to verify that people have remembered to remove their smart watches, fitbits, phones, laptops and so on.  \r\n\r\nI'm sure that some people who spend their lives going in and out of SCIF's would love to claim that they know the rules and should be allowed to determine what the correct devices are (I've certainly taken my Yubikey with me for example), but it's important to remember that even when we are specialists, we don't know everything, and furthermore, others around us who might be less capable will follow our lead.  \r\n\r\nI'm reminded of a tweet I saw recently which said:\r\n\r\n> [I can't tell you how many 'senior intelligence officers' I've worked with over the years - government, military, contractor - whose LinkedIn resumes look like they're goddamn Jack Ryan but who in reality are complete morons.](https://twitter.com/ZaknafienDC/status/1185310757451370496?s=20)\r\n\r\nIt's a good to remember that 50% of the membership of elite organisations like intelligence agencies are of course below average.  Our policies around security need to remember that as well.",

At around 9:30, he travels to work, always in a vehicle, always passing a Starbucks where he \u201ccould catch at least three creatures every time.\u201d (Niantic says that while Pok\u00e9mon will appear more frequently near Pokestops and Gyms, they do not appear more frequently near sponsored locations.)\r\n\r\nHowever, on one particular Monday, Laszlo deviated from his predicted path and visited a pharmacy near a shopping mall. While the rest of his day is unremarkable, in the evening, instead of taking his usual midnight stroll to the soccer fields, Laszlo\u2019s data went dark until the morning.\r\n\r\nKotaku asked Laszlo if he had been sick that day. He laughed. \u201cThe pattern is that I usually walk my dogs quite late to that sports complex\u2026 and I have two kids\u2026 so it happens quite often that I have to buy nasal drops from that pharmacy when they get a cold,\u201d he said. In itself, this deviation was not a juicy revelation.

Do we even make it obvious who to report it to?  For us, it might be clear that phishing emails are sent over to the Exchange team, but that potential drive by malware alerts should be raised with the IT security team, whereas a report from AWS Guard Duty should be handled by the digital security team.  But for many people in our organisations, they don't know who those teams are, how to contact them or how things are separated up.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm not the biggest fan of service desk software, like ServiceNow!, having a single easy front door for reporting issues, an internal triage or allocation team who can pass onto the right place means that users have a single easy way to raise issues.  This can improve the likelihood of people actually submitting issues, but it comes with a caveat.  As I've written before, [a service desk needs to be a crutch that enables good communication](https://medium.com/@bruntonspall/the-tyranny-of-the-service-desk-d1bc273b7c13), but doesn't get in the way of other communication mechanisms.  If someone approaches you directly, your team should never respond with \"Have you raised a ticket for that?\", but instead need to respond politely, helpfully, and probably also raise a ticket on their behalf.  \r\n\r\nSecondly, when a ticket or issue is raised, it's important that team communication is kept clear, simple and speedy.  A cyber security consultancy team that gets a question might not know the answer immediately, but could respond with something like \"We don't know the answer right now, we are consulting with some of our colleagues and will get back to you within 24 hours\".  Internally teams should be able to discuss questions on an internal mailing list, disagreeing with one another and helping educate one another, and then the team can respond formally after they have some internal consensus on the right advice or action to take. \r\n\r\nThis should work at the national level as well, as I've pointed out below, inter agency coordination is poor, and there are often not clear single government departments you should contact about something.  Having clear front doors for citizens to contact, and being able to route those queries internally, while giving the citizen feedback that their query or report is valuable and being dealt with will encourage people to report more often, and provide us with better information on what is really happening out there.",

                    "note": "(Jon) Someone was recently talking about \"cyber hygiene\" and mentioned it needing to be as normal for users to do the right thing \"as washing hands is for a doctor\". What's interesting is that washing hands wasn't always 'normal', particularly in the medical world.\r\n\r\nThere are many fascinating things about how doctors in the Victorian era underwent this change in behaviour. The first is how many of the male doctors failed to notice that their 'modern' techniques - yet unsanitary behaviours - were killing rather than curing more patients than those cared for by the female-dominated nursing and midwife professions. The second is that even when presented with clear evidence of the dangers of their behaviours, many of the Victorian doctors failed to believe it anyway - or didn't think it applied to _them_. The more we change, the more things stay the same.\r\n\r\nDo we see the same in cyber security? I'd argue at times \"yes\". Firstly, as Michael has regularly mentioned, we lack solid data on cyber security; a lot of cyber threat intelligence focusses on the malware, the threat actor, the on-target activities, but doesn't tell us much, if anything, about the way the infection began. And organisations are reluctant to share what's working and what's not; the data points we have are the outliers - those who feel confident to share their approaches (such as Google, with their BeyondCorp approach), or those who have no choice (e.g. an organisation that had a catastrophic breach). So we look at cyber security behaviours but cannot easily judge which are effective - so can formulate alternative rationales for why they might work.\r\n\r\nSo the first problem is identifying what really works - is it the ventilation system in the ward, or the hand washing that's causing the reduction in complications? Was it the blinky-anti-APT box, or the patching regime, or the email scanner, or maybe the user education and training, that led to a decrease in detected malware infections? The second problem is that once we do identify a 'basic hygiene' point, even as professionals do we believe it enough to do it?\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons medical professionals are now very good at washing their hands is not because they do a yearly eLearning course \"hand washing 101 - things to remember\" - but because the medical community has, in the last hundred years, learnt it has to make sanitation and hand cleaning an easy and integral thing to do. Having copious numbers of hand sanisation stations, building hand washing into medical protocols and procedures, even designing hospitals such that it's a natural step in a process - these are what makes it second nature. What's the cyber equivalent?",

The physicians performed the procedures barehanded, and they did not wash their hands afterward. Sometimes doctors performed examinations on pregnant women who succumbed to puerperal fever the day before. And then they went straight to the maternity ward - without washing their hands.",

I hope this frees up resources within NCSC to research and publish even more excellent advice and guidance, perhaps with a greater level of technical depth.\r\n\r\nBuilding secure technology is one thing... having any independent assurance of those security claims is another thing: I can't quite bring myself to say 'long live Common Criteria' but I can say that vendors looking to work with organisations that require it is a very useful carrot/stick to mandate and standardise security characteristics.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't appear to be NCSC's intention to take a back seat when it comes to international standards (!) so I hope NCSC keeps fighting the good fight to help the community build/update protection profiles that ripple increasingly better security practices through vendor products that underpin some really important systems (and thus, organisations).\r\n\r\n(Jon) Having worked with Common Criteria and other product assurance schemes for over a decade, I respectfully slightly disagree with Joel. I believe that what matters far more in terms of secure products and systems is the security engineering approach that the developer has - the way they consider threats through product development cycles, the way they train their developers, the security tooling they use in their build process to find and remove classes of vulnerabilities, the way they test, and so forth.

This is unlikely lead to blacklists or whitelists, more of a preference from an organisation's security perspective for Firefox over Chrome, but, on balance with other measurements (such as compatibility with G-Suite or Office 365) Chrome or Edge may still pull ahead when all metrics are balanced... after all, security is and should not be the only consideration.\r\n\r\n(Jon) I wonder about standards like these, especially in an issue of this newsletter where we're also linking to an item on Common Criteria. For the many faults in CC, the new-style Protection Profiles are much better at articulating what threats they're trying to address. Writing a security standard for a web browser is much more interesting - and difficult - in terms of articulating what you're trying to address.\r\n\r\nIn practice, I don't think this is a true standard; maybe more of a recognition of current good practices, which is no bad thing. However, without a clear threat model, it's hard to judge what achieving or deviating from this standard means. Does the lack of a master password on the password storage facility matter? For most people it's probably not that important. What about access of websites to sensor data - such as the battery status API in HTML5 ([https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/battery-status/](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/battery-status/)) - should that be a factor?\r\n\r\nWriting standards is _hard_, writing security standards especially so, as the world can move on whilst you're still drafting.

Invasions would become bloodless to the invaders and therefore one of the major policy controls preventing countries going to war, the civil unrest at home caused by the loss of life, would be neutralised.

It doesn't matter whether you are building a product that you sell, or writing policy for an organisation, you have real users and then you have decision makers.\r\n\r\nThe decision makers are the ones who are most visible to us by default.  They're the ones who will buy our product, and thus they are the ones who will look at the marketing, the feature lists or the cost.  But the product they buy will be inflicted on others in the organisation.\r\n\r\nIf you want to think of this experience yourself, just think about the last time you had to book travel or claim an expense.  I know people who have said that one of the questions that they ask when interviewing at a company is \"what expenses system do you use?\", give the wrong answer and they don't want to work there (at least not in any job that requires regular filing of expenses.  These systems are sold to the procurement team or the finance team, and sold with lots of ability to get users to correctly categorise and file their expenses in a way that makes finances job easier.  But many of them are actively hostile to the user, requiring the invocation of dark incantations and special commands to get even simple expenses into the system.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of many of our policies.  You could look at a social media policy in organisations, and many are designed to be read by the executive board, do not tell staff what they can do, but is covered in dire warnings that engaging in any social media contact is forbidden.  One organisation I worked with had a social media team of 4 people, all of whom had to work from their personal mobile phones, because the IT policy forbade access to Facebook or Twitter, and the departmental social media policy forbid them from mentioning anything about the organisation online.  The authors of those policies were not thinking about the users, the end users who would have to comply with the policy.\r\n\r\nOur security policies are often the same.  You should always ask yourself the question \"Who is supposed to read this and what do I want them to know?\".  Acceptable use policies that make reference to Section 3 Paragraph 2(a) of the Computer Misuse Act (1990), or Section 1, Paragraph 4(b) of the Official Secrets Act (1989) is almost certainly not useful to the end user.  What are they allowed to do? What are they not allowed to do?\r\n\r\nI've heard it attributed to Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, but this quote is one I use quite often:\r\n\r\n> Policies are organizational scar tissue. They are codi\ufb01ed overreactions to unlikely-to-happen-again situations.\r\n\r\nIf instead we write user centered policies and procedures, then we can be confident that users are clear on what is acceptable use, that they know whether they can tweet about their work, or ring their nursery from a work phone, and that they are covered and protected by the organisation.  That is what leads to better outcomes and safer organisations.",

Businesses that haven't gone to a cloud hosted email solution tend to have some form of remote access solution anyway, and many of those are far more poorly protected.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the most common attacks on Office 365 is password spraying (trying the top 5 most common passwords on thousands of accounts) and credential stuffing (trying to reuse passwords found in other breaches) are so common is because typical brute forcing, which probably works against your remote VPN or ExchangeOnline, don't work against Office 365, and so attackers have changed tactics.\r\n\r\nOn the VPN credential reuse thing, I'm a bit nervous of saying \"[Office 365] is not technically a part of your infrastructure\".\r\n\r\nCloud services that conduct authorisation and authentication for your staff, that contain the passwords and accounts, and that send and receive emails and documents on your behalf are very much part of your infrastructure.  The idea that Cloud services such as Office 365 and Google Suite are \"outside\" is broken thinking from the era of security as boundary control.

According to Microsoft, there are over 155 million Office 365 business users as of 2018, a massive attack surface for a single service. When you combine that with the fact that passwords get reused all the time\u2014maybe even for Active Directory integration (O365 makes this easy for Windows users for obvious reasons)\u2014it\u2019s no wonder threat actors see it as an appealing target.\r\n\r\nThe NCSC rightfully points out that because these services are cloud-based, and therefore accessible via the open Internet, attacks can be carried out at a much higher scale across the globe than previous on-premises infrastructure services allowed. Accessibility, in this case, puts defenders on their heels. The techniques observed being used are common ones as well: The NCSC highlights password spraying and credential stuffing as the main two attacks against Office 365 logins.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, even though we\u2019re talking about a cloud service that\u2019s not technically a part of your infrastructure, the compromised account for a service like Office 365 can lead to actual network intrusions. The NCSC has observed this scenario with VPN accesses. Users or administrators may set a VPN login to match that of the internal Active Directory, or another service to make it more convenient remembering a new set of credentials. Password reuse is an all too common technique used by attackers to get access to specific services",

What it does is give transparency and auditability of the supply chain.  You can look at the in-toto description of the supply chain for software as a service, software packages or other software and use that to make risk based judgements on how secure the tool is.  For example, you can verify that checkins are all signed by developers, or that the build was built by an authorised build server.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of trust points in this system though, you are reliant on developers keeping their private keys secure, on servers being configured appropriately and so on.  As is almost always the case, a lot of the security properties are reliant on the cryptographic keys being managed in a secure way, and that's rarely true for many systems.\r\n\r\nFor audit purposes, it's a nice idea.  It would be interesting to take a significant project, something built on several frameworks, for example a Rails project using a number of ruby libraries or a major Java SpringFramework project and try to work out the number of transitive dependencies and how much confidence you can actually build.",

The Oligopoly, as Liam Maxwell and Mike Bracken of GDS used to refer to them, is the collection of the big Systems Integrators, companies like CGI, Fujitsu, ATOS, Dell and others who did the majority of IT contracts for Government for so long.\r\n\r\nWhile it's perfectly possible to buy server hosting from the old Oligopoly, very few people did.  Instead they purchased \"Systems\", that could cover hosting, networking, wifi in buildings, support desks, internet connectivity, application support and all kinds of things.  The reason they are called Systems Integrators is that you buy a single large contract for, what is in essence an IT-department-in-a-box, and htey subcontract all the individual bits and provide you with a single view of the entire IT estate.  Except that they didn't. In many cases, the department didn't know what to buy, didn't know how to buy it, and trusted that the SI would make good choices.  They often also added restrictive language to the contract, ensuring that the IT couldn't be changed, and putting unnecessary demands on the SI teams delivering the kit.  I'm not defending the SI's here, but I don't think even with the best will in the world, they couldn't have delivered under those terms.\r\n\r\nThe modern cloud suppliers are totally different.  Because they are self-service, API and Web driven dashboards, they don't wrap the services up, they explicitly expose those services, allowing departments to build on top of them.  Within the subset of IT that is \"cloud hosting\", it might be easy to suggest that AWS, Google Compute and Azure are winning the majority of contracts, but that's still an unwrapped service.

If you read the [BeyondCorp research papers](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/), or read [the excellent book on Zero-Trust Networks (affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/30PTT4C), they really say that it is about a new paradigm of computing, it is about access brokers and identity aware proxies and policy enforcement on access and all that good stuff.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, Zero Trust is just a recognition that our IT no longer has borders or edges in the way we have traditionally thought.  That thinking pervades almost everything that we do, and it's incredibly difficult to shake off, so we still talk about \"our infrastructure\", or \"the network\" as if that's a thing.\r\n\r\nAnd in a modern Zero Trust network, we can see that these things are meaningless, but most of us are using IT systems that have extended away from the corporate controlled network a long time ago.  As soon as we started holding our data on other peoples computers, we extended the \"boundary\" of our system as a whole.  And for most organisations, that boundary is very fuzzy indeed.  Whether it be the tool that controls our mobile phones, or where we keep our emails, having that datastore held by someone else means that it is generally outside of our visibility.  But attacks on those external tools give attackers the ability to access our data, sometimes without even coming into our \"core network\", and sometimes because it provides us the keys to get in there legitimately.\r\n\r\nSoftware providers who hold our data, at the moment, have very poor auditing tools.  I've spent some time recently looking at common internet tools, like Github, Trello, Jira and so forth, to see what logs you can get out of those tools.  And while it's increasingly common to get my own user actions log (which of my users logged in and did certain actions), it's incredibly rare to get any logs that tell me what that suppliers systems administrators did, whether there was a new software deployment and so forth.  We also can't get any information on the security of that software supplier, so it's hard to know if they use encryption internally, or how they authenticate their staff.  Many will provide a statement that tells you that they follow good security practice, but without standards and assessments for this stuff, it's really hard to know what that means.\r\n\r\nThis is generally being recognised, and while I'm not a fan of certification, there are groups like the Cloud Security Alliance, who are looking at these things, and for certain simple cases (such as hosting, as loath as I am to call that simple), there are certificates that hold some meaning in terms of staff access, audit trails and so on.  But for more complex software, such as office productivity suites, HR tooling and so forth, we just haven't caught up yet.  And that means we have to take the security of these tools on trust for the most part.",

The key here is that we are talking about click bait headlines that are essentially untrue, but designed to hook you in and make you read further.  This gets worse online, culminating in the late 2000\u2019s with the Buzzfeed famous \u201cListicles\u201d such as \u201c23 ways to get rich\u201d or \u201c13 things rich people do, you won\u2019t believe number 5\u201d.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve got biased newspapers and online publications, who take facts and twist them to their own ends.  As [Ad Fontes Media\u2019s chart of biases](https://www.adfontesmedia.com/) shows, media outlets have biases, and those on the far right and the far left have a tendancy to be less truthful, and build stories that twist the facts to cover the narrative that they care about.  This has always happened, but the internet has made it easier for niche extreme views to get more traction and more readers than ever before.  Additionally, it\u2019s difficult for most people to know the biases and be able to tell the biases apart, and so they treat all news as truthful or false.\r\n\r\nBut none of that counts as hostile social manipulation, that requires nation state level interference normally, and an endgoal in mind.  As I\u2019ve said before, the end goal of different nations is different and as such we aren\u2019t going to be able to take the activities of Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency and apply them to how Catalan rebels operation, or the Chinese media disinformation campaigns are operating.  Any attempt to claim that we can detect that level of interference and re-apply it is bound to fail.\r\n\r\nThere are similarities, but the actual tactics and strategy changes from country to country and from campaign to campaign.

The careful, manipulative liar who gets a job, specifically with a hostile motive in mind.  Whether you think he was right or wrong, he reinforced a set of insider threat models that have been abused for a long time.\r\n\r\nI attended a brief training seminar on insider threats a few years back, and the examples given were those of the Burgess, Mclean, Blunt, Philby and Cairncross (the Cambridge Five), Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowdon.  This is in spite of the fact that [CPNI's own review of 120 insider cases](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/system/files/documents/63/29/insider-data-collection-study-report-of-main-findings.pdf) showing that only 6% of insiders were motivated to apply for a role in order to get information, and that only a further 15% were recruited or influenced by outsiders.  Given that the study was of both public and private sectors, it still shows that 76% of insiders are people who make the decision to become an insider once working for an organisation.  I would hazard a guess that deliberate decision to join and being influenced by an outsider is far more common in the military and intelligence arms of the public sector and the private sector relating to it, than it is in any other area, so those ratios are probably inflated.\r\n\r\nBut the real insider threat for many of us is not the hostile insider.  It's the people we trust who are socially engineered into revealing information that they shouldn't.  It's malware infected devices that can act like an insider even if the user isn't malicious themselves, and it's misconfiguration and user error.  The [data breaches survey 2019](https://enterprise.verizon.com/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/2019/results-and-analysis/) reminds us that nearly 40% of data breaches are error or mishandling. We can add to that misconfiguration, with databases being exposed online as a regular occurance, and increasingly the open source nature of code resulting in accidental misconfiguration.\r\n\r\nOf course the scariest insider threat is that from a supplier.  I'm not even sure if we can accurately describe the software supply chain, let alone map it in 2019.  Software is written by humans, who are often outsourced from another company.  They use laptops, tools and software to write their code, store it on third party source code hosting repositories, and build it using third party build pipelines.  The code is then shipped to data centers, where it is run by third parties on your behalf and exposed to the internet via ISP's.  And of course each of these suppliers runs their own laptops, hardware, operating systems.  The idea that under all of this somewhere, there is a boundary where insecure people are outside, and only security approved things are allowed in and onto our network became unfeasible decades ago.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite the huge impact of an insider, the actual incidents of real damaging insider threat is really rare.  We might spend millions on data loss prevention software, role based access controls and managed procurement processes to ensure that nobody buys slack for their teams which might allow collaboration outside the company and therefore accidental data loss.  But is this the best way to protect ourselves against this risk?  Is it even a risk we should worry about?  \r\n\r\nI return to that 40% error and data mishandling figure, and realise that if we spent as much money on ensuring that email clients were intuitively obvious about the use of the CC field and the BCC field.  That we had modern digital tools for collaborating on documents and spreadsheets that meant that they didn't get emailed everywhere, maybe we'd be a lot better off.",

There's a parallel into the cyber security world here - if we get hacked, it's human nature to say it was Advanced Persistent Threats, throwing chains of zero-days at us in a humint-enabled blended attack, and not that we forgot to change a default password and left RDP open. Could it have theoretically been DeepFake AI? Possibly. Was it more likely to be someone chancing their arm? Almost certainly.\r\n",

In part this is inertia, and in part it is fear that a change in policy might violate some compliance requirement. The problem here is that regulators have a nasty habit of using practice by value rather than practice by reference, so there will be cases where the older NIST or similar guidance has been hard coded. This is compounded by the fact that most published policy demands \u2018what\u2019 (and sometimes \u2018how\u2019) without bothering to explain \u2018why\u2019, so the threads of connection to the regulation that shaped policy get cut, making it much harder to determine the impact of a policy change.",

As the article that Jon links to points out however, this is exactly how \"fakenews\" happens.

Martin Robbins wrote [a great explainer](https://waitingforglados.com/robbins-martin/articles/is-gov-uk-part-of-a-brexit-conspiracy/) that shows just how the misunderstanding blew up, and how it then started to spiral out of control on twitter (and sadly wont die based on the people I follow).\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean for us?  As Jon points out below, we tend to overrate the competence and capabilities of our adversaries, as well as overestimate our importance or value to them.  We would rather build defences against the advanced persistent threats than worry about the real risks to our business.  Dr Ian Levy used to give a talk where he said that most \"APT\"'s weren't very advanced, gave up far too easily and aren't really a threat if you have even a basic line of defense.  He said that we should be calling them annoyingly pernicious toerags, because it's more representative of them.  I partly disagree in that I think there are real APT's out there, it's just that I think for most of us, we aren't really in their sights.  We might be collateral damage, but often we are one of many ways that they can achieve their aims, and like water, they will take the easiest route to where they want to go.  \r\n\r\nThe real pain is those annoying pernicious toerags, mostly because there's a lot more of them, and they make up a lot more of the real threats to our systems.  Business Email Compromise, Ransomware, self-spreading malware.  These are the things that are mostly likely to try to hit us, and the things we should worry about, rather than the sorts of things I highlight on a weekly basis, the deepfakes and the cool VPN bypasses.",

The second, known as the discriminator, then determines whether the outputs are real by comparing each one with the same training examples.\r\n\r\nEach time the discriminator successfully rejects the generator\u2019s output, the generator goes back to try again.

            "intro": "How much do we trust machines?  It turns out, according to research I read this week, that the majority of people expect an automated aid to perform better at a task than a human.  That can include examples such as navigation, driving aids, medical checklists and automated highlighting systems.\r\n\r\nAI is a hugely wide and advanced field but journalists and observers are not equipped enough to actually understand many of the topics that come up.  The more I read, the more I realise just how poor the average level of technical awareness actually is in policy and journalistic professionals.  If you haven't read [James Ball and Ad Greenway's Bluffocracy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07C3FQ6GV), then it's worth a read, but in essence the very people that we expect to hold politicians and civil servants to account are often ill equipped to actually carry out that function.  The typical technology journalist is expected to cover everything from cyber security to the launch of new apple devices, mobile phones to new networking equipment.  And the we have journalists covering policy areas like health, defence and cyber, and very rarely do they have a technology background to understand the impact of technology.\r\n\r\nBehind all of this is the unending technological revolution that just keeps changing and improving on computing, not to mention to sociological impact on the humans involved in these systems.  I follow technology closely and have a background in writing code and building systems, and I feel like I can barely scratch the surface of AI advances in deep fakes, or the privacy impacts of our technology.\r\n\r\nAs Arthur Clarke famously said, \"Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic\", and we have to trust in magic, because we can't do anything else.  For most users of the systems that we build, they have to trust that the machine does magic and tells them what to do and when to do it.  Trust is implicit in the use of these advanced systems, and that means that we feel we have to trust in the internet giants, or else opt out of modern society.\r\n\r\nOf course fraudsters and criminals like to take advantage of blind trust that is granted to technology systems.  How we will build appropriate trust in our technology systems is an area of study that desperately need work. In the meantime, we need to ensure that our systems are trustworthy and able to demonstrate their workings, so that trust can be built and maintained.",

Phinney, who describes himself as the Font Detective, noticed that the Ledge Lodge document supposedly written in 1995 used the Cambria font, while the Humber Station document used Calibri.\r\n\r\nBoth of these fonts were part of the ClearType font collection developed for Microsoft in 2002, which didn\u2019t become available to the general public until the company used it in Vista and Office 2007 five years later.

On one hand I am a firm believer that many organisations focus on entirely the wrong things, on back to back multi-vendor firewalls and sheep-dip antivirus systems for JSON payloads, when those things don't actually ameliorate the risks that the organisations face, they just make busy work.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a set of fairly basic things that you should do in 99% of contexts, because there are a set of general risks to operating an IT estate that people use.  You shouldn't give domain admin credentials to everyone on the network, you shouldn't just allow anyone to access anything at any time, and you shouldn't connect your supercomputer directly to the internet to mine bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with risk management techniques is that many, even the ones I like, are overbearingly complicated, slow and heavyweight to apply, and rarely make sense outside of the context that they were done.  Traditional well accepted models used in risk management don't make sense in a lot of cases.  Case in point, I was discussing threat actor classifications with someone junior the other day, and they had outlined a set of actor types including hactivist; organised crime; insiders and foreign intelligence.  So far, so normal, they had correctly identified some of the traditional actor groupings.  But when you actually being to look at it, insiders have a variety of motivations and skills.  No two insiders are going to want to do the same thing, in the same way, and even if you can identify classes of insiders you are worried about (rogue sysadmin, bribed case workers etc), you now have a hugely complex set of potential actor types, and it's still unclear how to relate those to the systems you are trying to protect.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, I've sat through lots of risk identification sessions, looking at what might attack systems, both in traditional methods, using a variety of experimental methods, as well as my prefered attack tree methodology.  I don't think Business Email Compromise fraud has ever come up in any of those risk sessions, because the sessions were driven by technology, or by security process, and rarely rooted in data on real compromises.\r\n\r\nI wish there was a better way, but I've not seen anything that works better than \"hire smart people and let them do their thing\", and sadly that doesn't scale.  As a pragmatist, I tend to hold views quite loosely.  I encourage people to conduct risk assessment sessions, but I don't hold the results up as perfect, and I'm content also applying a baseline of security measures that I don't feel the need to risk assess or determine a business need for.  I spend time trying to cover at least the worst 80%, and that should put us into a far safer place than we were before.",

My personal view is that Project Zero's exploit write-ups, and the many great write-ups by the Pwn2Own competitors and other security research teams (Pangu and other Chinese teams come to mind) about the actual internal mechanisms of their exploits is invaluable to transmit understanding of actual attacks to defenders, and are necessary to help the industry stay on course.",

Social media platforms are under increasing pressure to re- spond (Trindade, 2018), but automated removal of such content risks further suppressing already- marginalized voices (Yasin, 2018; Dixon et al., 2018). Thus, great care is needed when develop- ing automatic toxic language identification tools.\r\nThe task is especially challenging because what is considered toxic inherently depends on social context (e.g., speaker\u2019s identity or dialect). In- deed, terms previously used to disparage com- munities (e.g., \u201cn*gga\u201d, \u201cqueer\u201d) have been re- claimed by those communities while remaining offensive when used by outsiders (Rahman, 2012). Figure 1 illustrates how phrases in the African American English dialect (AAE) are labelled by a publicly available toxicity detection tool as much\r\nmore toxic than general American English equiv- alents, despite their being understood as non-toxic by AAE speakers (Spears, 1998, see \u00a72).",

The cyber kill chain (TM Lockheed Martin) is about determining that a successful attack requires a number of steps, and that the failure of any one step will prevent the entire operation from being carried out.  \r\nIt's an arguably useful model for defenders because it encourages defenders to look for a wider spectrum of attack signals, so that they can catch and kill attacks before they start.  In a world where the final stages of an attack can be brutally fast, this is critical.\r\n\r\nDisinformation campaigns aren't like that, and this Lawfare article even points it out.  If you are able to affect an early stage of an operation, then the operation might be less effective, but it won't stop it.  It's therefore not a kill chain at all.\r\n\r\nWhy does that matter?  Because there are a lot of people who haven't studied any of this stuff, and will attempt to apply the model/language/thinking from one kill chain to another.  And that cognitive dissonance will cause more problems than it will solve.\r\n\r\nAs a model for 7 critical factors in disinformation, I think this is a reasonable model, but when defending against it, we need to defend against all 7 factors at once, and possible equally, rather than focusing on the early stages first.",

            "intro": "Privacy is a really interesting concept to study.  People have lots of different mental concepts of privacy, and oftentimes those concepts don't entirely align with other humans conceptions of the same behaviours.  Couples talk about wanting privacy to be a couple together, and sometimes individuals wants privacy from their partner.  Groups of people who socialise build \"private parties\" and ways to segment themselves, and we tend to just keep using the same word over and over.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, we hand data out like candy, even surprisingly private data at times.  We post updates to social networks and take photos of our food at fancy restaurants.  We give our address and phone number to every Dick, Tom, and Harry store that needs it, and we rarely consider how all of that data can be analysed or understood.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, a lot of data analytical firms also tend to overstate just how good their analytical capabilities actually are.  Many, if not all of them, are focused on advertising and advertising is a numbers game.  If you want to put adverts for new bags in front of potential consumers, you are hoping to put them in front of thousands of people all of whom have a higher than average desire to buy a new bag.  Getting a few hundred of those people mislabeled is a bad thing, and so analytical firms tend to be happy if their analysis is wrong about you as an individual, providing it's accurate in aggregate.\r\n\r\nBut as society gets more networked, and as organisations realise that this data can be used for more than just advertising (even Cambridge Analytica scandal was about selling political adverts at its essence), we start to see the scary side of data harvesting and abuse.\r\n\r\nAnd the big problem is that as an individual, we really struggle to engage with privacy processes, because it's not clear what actually happens to that data, and the whole subject is so nuanced that different individuals have different lines of what they think is acceptable.  I don't think we have any good answers here yet (and I feel like I say that a lot at the moment), but it's good to see that across a variety of areas, from AI to biometrics, vehicle licenses to number plate recognition, there is a constantly moving discussion and battleground about what is acceptable, and what we can do to affect that conversation.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice a slightly different look today.  I had some feedback, months ago, that the large quotes in italic font can be hard to read, especially if you have dyslexia.  I've tried to format the quotes to be a little more readable, with no italic font, but still looking like a pull quote and feeling distinct.  As always, please let me know if you like it, hate it, can't read it.  I welcome all feedback.",

Monzo's response to PIN's being found in their logs was excellent, both in terms of response, but also in terms of managed infrastructure, but they have it easy, with a relatively green field digital system.  Enterprise IT is a whole different ball game for many of these smaller organisations, with deployment of thousands of computers, many with different users and different needs, all using a multitude of different services on the network.  There isn't a lot of developer experience in building enterprise IT wide automation and configuration management.  There are some tools do some of this, but many of the people working in enterprise IT aren't developers, they don't understand program code, and they haven't been given the skills to do the job that's now required of them.\r\n\r\nThis is a security nightmare, because we know that \"devops\" and agile give us the ability to make changes more rapidly, more safely and more efficiently.  But without that safety and rapidity, rolling out patches and updates to the corporate estate is slow, painful and prone to failure.  That means that we do it less often, and that leaves a gap into which criminal organisations can slide.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to take devops and agile principles and apply them to our enterprise IT, ensuring that we have code that describes what our infrastructure and devices should look like, and that we can make changes confidently and quickly.  That's far from easy to actually do, but as I've said in the past, we need to do the hard work to make it simple.",

People moving their servers from an on-premise or colocated data center into Azure, Google Cloud, AWS or similar.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, much of the moving to the cloud is the migration of working tools to SaaS vendors, from your queue of work to Trello or Jira, to using Salesforce for your CRM.  \r\n\r\nThis cloud adoption is much quieter, has a lot less notice, and isn't generally part of company's \"cloud strategy\" documents.  And yet, it probably has just as sensitive data and information as your data center does, especially if you are talking sales leads, customer contact information and case management.\r\n\r\nBut security advice for SaaS tooling is almost non existent.  Both for vendors, in how they should do access control, management or reporting, and also for consumers in what to look for and what tools, capabilities and policies you might need.\r\n\r\nThe Jira bug is the sort of thing that will occur time and time again, where it's possible to open stuff up to the world, and not clear to users how that happened or the implications there of.  \r\n\r\nWe need better standards for things like API's to enable policy compliance checks and automated scanning. Standards allowing for the download of access logs and authentication and audit logs would make detection of these things easier.  Until we have those, we are reliant on the good practices of both the vendors of SaaS tools, and the users within our organisation of configuring and using these tools correctly",

When that\u2019s the case, there are compensatory actions you can take that compensate for the lack of ability to patch.\r\n\r\nWhat Emma doesn\u2019t say here is that if you have systems that fall into the categories of hard to patch, using those compensatory defence in depth principles is not enough.  You should also look to rework the conditions that make it hard to patch to try to make it easier to patch.  If you have a system that you cannot patch because someone hosts it for you, then come contract renewal time, consider putting in patch SLA\u2019s into the renewal contract, so that you can request patches in the future.",

After an afternoon of going back and forth, I walked away feeling emotionally drained. What had happened to my amazing coworkers that were so kind and wonderful? I felt attacked and diminished. It seemed people weren\u2019t valuing my work or my judgment. \r\n\r\nI went home for the weekend and stewed in my frustration.

I wanted to give them direct feedback that they had hurt my feelings. \r\n\r\nAs I went back through that Friday afternoon chat log, I was shocked to see that no one had been hurling insults. There was no one saying mean things about me or attacking my efficacy directly.

The entire engineering department definitely made their criticisms known, but I didn\u2019t find people questioning my ability as a manager, throwing around insults, or saying anything that that illustrated why I was feeling so targeted. \r\n\r\nThat was when something became crystal clear: my coworkers hadn\u2019t become monsters, they were still the kind and caring people I thought they were.

It is unclear whether high-privacy sites will also be inspected (for example, online banking) and examples from those in-country have shown Facebook.com as being intercepted. This is... problematic... at best.\r\n\r\nMature root certificate trust store distributors (Microsoft for Windows, Apple for macOS/iOS, Mozilla etc) have standing policies to reject/block any attempts to distribute root certificates through their schemes so of course Kazakhstan is resorting to asking individuals to manually install the offending certificate to allow their web traffic to be intercepted for unknown purposes.

It should be impossible for any MITM CA to meet this criteria, and as such it will never be added to the global trust root.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting question here is whether the browser user manually installing a CA certificate knows what they are doing.  Firefox currently assumes that you do, and even disables certificate pinning in these circumstances!  That combined with the dual use of this certificate (Kazakhstan use the same certificate to generate the TLS certificates for the citizen facing government services) means that users are quite likely to install the certificate without realising the impact of doing so",

One of my favourites is [\"Do the hard work to make it simple\"](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#do-the-hard-work-to-make-it-simple).  I like that this goes counter to our normal narrative of \"just\", \"simply\" and \"basic\" that suggests that making something simple is easy.  Often, doing the most basic simple things is the hardest thing to do, because simple clean clear elegance takes a lot of hard work.\r\n\r\nThe Zoom exploit is a good version of this. The zoom team felt that they were making it simple for users to join a meeting, but doing it in such a way that honours someone's privacy and security decisions is actually really hard.\r\n\r\nA good strategy for organisations is one that drastically focuses on the basics, on putting in all the hard work to get the basics right, not because the more advanced stuff is harder, but because the more advanced stuff tends to follow from the basics.  Do all the machine learning, AI, blockchain and quantum computing stuff you like, but if you haven't got the basics of patching, of monitoring, of security awareness down, then you aren't going to be able to make use of those technologies.  \r\n\r\nI'm not a luddite, I don't think there's no value in those technologies, indeed, I think that many of them can be very valuable and useful in the right places, but they have to build on a good strong foundation, and if your focus is the innovative and the shiny, then you'll leave the basics alone because doing the basics is much harder and often feels less rewarding.",

Or perhaps it intended to signal technical capacity to adversaries as a deterrent.

            "intro": "The shift in policy of moving the reins of power of offensive cyber from intelligence organisations like the NSA or GCHQ over to military organisations like the US CyberCommand or the Ministry of Defence is an interesting one.\r\n\r\nThe military has always claimed that Cyber is the fifth domain of warfare (the others being Land, Sea, Air and Space).  Interestingly the russian doctrine uses a word that is closer to Information rather than our use of Cyber, to mean the same thing, and this might be why Russia is so much more advanced in disinformation tactics than the west.\r\n\r\nI find this move of power (which happened years ago, but is coming to the fore now), deeply worrying.  Regardless of your views on espionage and spying agencies, one of the advantages of espionage driven cyber campaigns is that it is an extension of diplomatic soft power around the world.  Countries generally don't want to be caught spying on each other, even if it's an open secret that they do.  It's undiplomatic to accuse another country of spying without solid evidence, and shaming to be caught.  \r\n\r\nThis means that cyber operations under a diplomatic arm are designed not to inspire awe, shock and fear, but to gather intelligence, to stay quiet and to very deniably damage an adversary countries ability to conduct offensive missions.  It encourages restraint and caution in the operations conducted and the doctrine behind it.\r\n\r\nHowever military commands have almost always been more about hard power, and the inspiration of shock and awe.  To quote Tony Stark, \"the best weapon is not one you don't have to use, but one you only ever have to use once\".  Offensive cyber missions with this doctorine are likely to take on a far different cast to them, one that is difficult to achieve on a global, distributed system like the internet.  How is it possible to claim and demonstrate your complete and unabiding power without affecting a global marketplace of businesses?  How much do military commands care about the impact on the governance and structure of the internet itself?\r\n\r\nThese are questions that I hope are being asked and answered within CyberCommand structures around the world, but as I've said before, the asymmetry of cyberweapons is quite astounding.  It's entirely possible for a nation to build highly capable offensive capabilities without the requisite defensive capabilities, and leads to arms races.  Additionally, it's entirely possible to have, own and operate cyber weapons of various forms without needing to understand the technicalities of the battleground on which they will be used, without needing to know what the internet actually is or how it works.\r\n\r\nThese are the thoughts that keep me up at night far more than worries about meeting software turning on my webcam (but more on that next week!)",

Although it's not been publicly confirmed yet, but I'd wager that the most likely source of infection for those ransomware attacks was an email with either an attachment or link to malware in it.\r\n\r\nTraditional advice has been not to click suspicious links, but as has been shown time and time again, normal users can't tell suspicious from normal, and since their job is to receive email, open the documents or click the links, it is advice that just doesn't work.\r\n\r\nModern systems can perform link and malware detonation, checking links against known URL blacklists, and opening attachments in a VM and checking the system log to discover if anything weird happens.  With the addition of modern up to date browsers (Firefox patched their 0-day for javascript within days, but whether that has been installed on corporate devices is another matter), and modern protection on operating systems, you should be making it hard for attackers to get malware onto your systems.\r\n\r\nOf course, when it does happen, ransomware is proving more and more popular.  The only reason I can see to pay the ransom is if your critical corporate data is not backed up anywhere and you would lose more data than the ransom is worth.  Backing up your shared file drives, and of course, moving to cloud based productivity suites should give you a healthy buffer against ransomware attacks and ensure that you can clean down your systems and get fixed.  Cloud based productivity tools will also mean that while your corporate IT system is infected, your staff can continue working from their own devices, from home, from coffeeshops or from shared office locations.\r\n\r\nSadly, many security people see all of these things as bad security practices.  The fear of upstream updates breaking systems mean they don't patch, and the fear of data loss from bad employees means that access to any corporate data from any device that isn't rigidly controlled by IT is often forbidden.  The use of compensatory controls, such as checking a devices security posture and patch levels is seen as not good enough for protecting corporate data, and yet would give significant business benefit and improve recovery capability in the event of the worst happening",

That's a huge percentage of the malware, and shows that good generic malware with changeable payloads does have a market dominance effect.  Interestingly until recently Emotet was primarily banking malware, but it's been reclassified by Proofpoint this quarter as \"botnet\" malware instead.  This is because Emotet spreads and then takes command and control from a central location, including downloading a second stage for for exploitation.  This can be something like TrickBot which uses the EternalBlue and DoublePulsar exploits to spread, or can be traditional banking malware like Dridex.\r\n\r\nThe primary method for Emotet to spread is via email attachments and links in email.  Therefor we are back to the normal advice of \"don't click links in emails\".  But as Proofpoint says here, you should assume that users will click.

These things don\u2019t reveal the intent of the malware, but it\u2019s pretty easy for a savvy user to notice that something suspicious is going on.\r\n\r\nMore interesting is the fact that the malware runs via emulation, when it could easily have run as native code. This would have given the malware better performance and a smaller footprint. Further, the fact that the malware runs two separate miners, each running from their own 130 MB Qemu image file, means that the malware consumes far more resources than necessary.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Bird Miner was created this way likely indicates that the author probably is familiar with Linux, but is not particularly well-versed in macOS. Although this method does obfuscate the miner itself, which could help the malware evade detection, that benefit is countered by reliance on shell scripts and the heavy footprint of running not one but two miners simultaneously in emulation.\r\n\r\nObviously, this malware provides a solid example of why piracy is not a good idea.

That the cyber criminals will breach your systems and steal all of your data?\r\nMalware, distributed by email or phishing is still the biggest threat to most businesses, and of that malware, the most common is still ransomware.  Malware families like Emotet spread because users open attachments to their email and infect their machine.  That malware then spreads from machine to machine, using tools like Mimikatz to steal credentials and move from machine to machine.  The payload that they eventually drop is normally some form of ransomware.\r\n\r\nWe've seen cities bought to their knees by this, both those that paid the ransomware fee and those that didn't, and of course, how much can you trust someone who has demanded money from you.  Once it's public that you were a victim, everyone else will know that you were infected and you could be high on the target lists in future.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about ransomware and malware attacks?  We know that training users not to click doesn't work because most users have to open attachments as part of their job!  Strong multi-layer defences do work against email based malware attacks.  If you are using a modern cloud productivity suite such as Office 365 or Google Suite, then you almost certainly get world class scanning as part of that productivity package.  But additionally you need antivirus running on your desktop machines that can catch malware when it executes.  You also need to contain the infection, and try to prevent it spreading around your network.  This is harder, but segmented networks are the way to go to ensure that the spread is contained only to a small business area rather than your entire organisation.\r\n\r\nTools and magic black boxes that are designed to prevent \"Advanced Persistent Attackers\" are often snakeoil in a can.  Most of the reports from APT's shows that they'll start with just sending you simple malware by email, the same as all the other attackers, and only if that doesn't work will they move on to more advanced techniques.  Make them work for it and protect yourself against the lowest common denominator of attacks.",

You think it could be hidden in one of three equally likely locations, A, B or C. You pick one, say site C, and start to prep the arms control inspectors for a snap inspection. The host country then unexpectedly throws open one of the other sites, site A, to journalists so it is obviously not there. You have the chance to change your advice to the inspection team and tell them now to go to site B or stick with your original choice, C. Should you change, or stick to C?\r\n\r\nWhen posed this question, analysts immediately split into two camps. The minority quickly spots the underlying structure of what in North America is known as the \u201cMonty Hall problem,\u201d from the name of the game show host.[viii] As a problem in probability it is straight forward, if paradoxical. The majority of analysts who have not come across the problem refuse to believe the result when they first come across it but can be persuaded to follow the probabilistic reasoning, as set out in Figure 1.\r\n\r\nThat, however, is the start of the teaching point. The analysis of the probabilities in the graphic depends upon a set of strict assumptions that are not explicit in the question. For the intelligence analyst little, if anything, should be taken for granted, especially statements from the opponent. What unlocks a proper analysis of the problem for the analyst is understanding where implicit assumptions are being made about the reporting being received. For example, do we assume that the opponent knows which initial site was picked (the question does not say so)? If not, the solution is quite different. Would it be safe not to assume he knows, given the history of arms inspection regimes? Is the opponent engaged in deception, using the media as a shield? Can it be safely assumed that the opponent who threw open the site was privy to the secret of where the bio-trailer was actually located? And so on.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the problem reduces to a number of alternative hypotheses, on a number of different assumptions, and the analyst can use the Heuer table approach to rank these. Our calculations show that the problem is asymmetric: the wise analyst will advise switching on the grounds that some assumptions will improve the prediction, while on others it makes the chances no worse.",

It is the same with security policies: when employees encounter security policies that are impossible to follow or are clearly not effective, it provides a justification for doubting all security policies. That is why security hygiene is essential. When policies are not being followed, security professionals must investigate, in a nonconfrontational manner, why and if it is because they are impossible or too onerous to follow and re-design the solution. \r\n\r\nKirlappos et al. pointed out that in most cases, employees do not show blatant disregard for security, but try to manage the risk they understand in the best way know how, what they call shadow security [37]. Their \u2018amateur\u2019 security solutions may not be entirely effective from a security perspective, but since they are \u2018workable\u2019, asking \u2018how could we make that secure\u2019 is a good starting point for finding an effective solution that fits in with how people work.",

We are constantly talking about and worrying about being attacked, about what is the worst that can happen, about the nations in a constant state of cyberwar!\r\n\r\nBut we overly focus on the negative.  I took at a look at the stories that I read for this week, and I had around 35 stories selected as potential stories to go in here, from a digital transformation failure in Denmark, to Snapchat spying tools, from updates on the spread of banking trojans to worries about chinese backdoors in drones (I'll feature all of those next week).\r\n\r\nBut I put a request out with friends for any positive stories, any blog posts or information on cyber security successes, on people building and showing great advances in cybersecurity.  And I got nothing back.  Nobody had a good story to tell, or at least share.\r\n\r\nA friend was commenting on a common interview question that they ask people, \"Which is better from a security perspective, IaaS, PaaS or SaaS?\" and that the common answer was IaaS (apart from one wag who said \"On Premise Hardware\"), and it got us thinking about why that is.  The stated reason from a security perspective is often claimed to be control.  That with fewer layers of abstraction between your system and the underlying supplier, you have more visibility than you would with a more abstract system.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't believe that it's the case that a PaaS is necessarily more or less secure than an IaaS.  I don't think the level of abstract necessarily changes the level of security of the whole thing, but it does change your approach to security.  I think that a good PaaS provider is probably providing you with a more secure platform than if you badly manage your IaaS yourself, but it's hard to know whether the PaaS provider is doing any of the things you need.  With greater abstraction comes greater trust in the vendor or their assurance mechanisms.  \r\n\r\nWe seem to struggle with trust as a profession, I suspect because we spend so much time professionally thinking about what can go wrong.\r\n\r\nI decided to try to find as many positive stories about how things are getting better, or specifically, where people have implemented new tools, techniques or processes that enable us all to learn and see how things can be better.  There is hope, there are people making things better, it's just harder to see amongst all of the cynicism.  This week should give you some insight into that I hope",

            "intro": "I've been involved in a bunch of conversations recently around \"baseline controls\".  What is the difference between different security controls, and how should we decide where to invest our money.\r\n\r\nOne train of thought is that any set of security controls that aren't linked back to something the business cares about have very limited value, because any breach of that control, or alert connected to that control is not going to get any response from the business.  That without doing some form of risk based assessment, you can't select the appropriate controls or know what the right alerts and actions should be.\r\n\r\nI tend to prefer a different train of thought, that there are a set of simple cybersecurity controls that are almost always always appropriate, in let's say 99% of contexts and situations, and that you don't need to perform a risk assessment or connect it to a business concern to make it useful.\r\n\r\nI think the assumption that everything needs to be context specific tends to fall into the trap of assuming that there is a duality in the organisation, between the business and IT/Security.  Somehow there is some magical part of the organisation that is \"the business\" that is the only part that really matters or has an opinion.  If you don't have buy-in or acceptance from the business then whatever you do is not valuable.  But people often can't really define who the business actually is in this case.  You can point at the common suspects, policy and operational teams in government, editorial teams in a newspaper, and so on.  But how about the estates team, are they the business, can they decide what security controls you should have around some of your IT systems?  How about the HR team, the operations team, or the COO?\r\n\r\nIn reality, security and IT are responsible for their own security concerns, and they don't need to be driven by a business concern that is bigger or wider than them.  They can decide that measuring the number of failed logins, or use of credentials out of hours from unusual geographic locations is the sort of thing that they should monitor without needing to have a business driver for that decision.\r\n\r\nFurther to this, I think within IT systems, there are a set of things that are worth logging and tracking because, regardless of the IT context, they provide value to detective, responsive or forensic teams.  Even if your system currently doesn't track those things, and if you have no ability to react and respond to failed login attempts, once you know you are compromised, this information on logins will form a forensic trail that will enable someone to work out where the attackers went and what they did.\r\n\r\nWhat is included in that baseline is a much harder question, but it's why I'm so happy to see tools like Logging Made Easy that shows a good attempt at an implementation of a baseline.  I'm not sure it's perfect, but if I was looking for a starting place for such a logging baseline, it's a damn good working example.\r\n\r\nOf course, the critical thing about a baseline is that once we've worked out what it is, it needs to be continually adjusted to keep up with technology changes, and to be continually raised.",

Organisations like the US have highly advanced cyber offensive capabilities, but across the nation, not just at the Government level, but in the critical industries and businesses, the defensive capability is so low.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do about it?  While I've got some issues with NCSC's anti patterns document, there's a lot of good in there, in attempting to bust some myths of the past, and show that there are good ways to build new systems.  My biggest worry is all of the legacy IT systems out there, built over the last 40 years, that is hard to patch, hard to fix the security vulnerabilities.  There's only 2 real strategies that you can operate on for a cyber defensive strategy. The first is to focus on improving that legacy estate, protecting it, detecting attempts to get in, and reducing the blast radius when it does get compromised.  The second is to focus on the new stuff you are building, and ensure that tomorrows legacy is in a better state than today's.  You can't focus too much on one, as the other will kill you, so you need to balance your attention between them.",

We discuss how these techniques can frustrate efforts by researchers to understand the objectives of a campaign and reach conclusive attribution.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nTypically, after the inauthentic articles were posted to Twitter, amplified by third parties, or covered by mainstream media, Endless Mayfly deleted the content and redirected visitors to the legitimate media outlets that they were impersonating.

That if we've exposed the data of millions of users, that someone has actively exploited it and done terrible things with it.\r\n\r\nBut the reality isn't like that most of the time for most of us.  These huge data breaches that happen all the time show up to have very little impact on real users.  It's incredibly hard to get any reliable statistics about identity fraud caused by data breaches.  It clearly happens, and when the police capture fraudsters, they often find that they had access to large amounts of user data, but it's very hard to draw a specific link.\r\n\r\nI don't necessarily mind that we are pessimists about data breaches, that in risk management we prepare for the worst, because if we're prepared for the worst, then if it's not as bad as we thought, then our systems should respond better.\r\n\r\nBut it does cause us to make weird decisions sometimes.  I've sat in meetings talking about risk, and the ever present advanced persistent threats tend to outweigh doing the simple easy stuff, because the risk management processes look at risk as \"Likelihood times Impact\".  But the impact is always the worst case, and we don't have a good way to model \"likely impact\" or \"median impact\" instead.\r\n\r\nSensible thinking should lead you to the view that the most common breach, with middling to low impact, is password stuffing and account compromise.  We know that solving this is easy, simple and fast with things like 2FA.  But instead we end up discussing the weaknesses of the global telecommunications system and whether the SMS will transit a Huawei switch at any point before reaching the user, or whether a users mobile phone is truly a second factor if they're also browsing on it.  The highly unlikely, but huge impact stuff dominates our thinking and prevents simple pragmatic solutions from being used.\r\n\r\nThe oft quoted \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" is a good phrase to remember.  We try so hard to model everything, and to worry about the really hard and difficult stuff, and not enough time just delivering the good stuff we can do now.",

Their commercial mechanism for profit is to find vulnerabilities, package them up and sell them to Governments and Law Enforcement for use.\r\n\r\nThe security community rounded on WhatsApp for their patch notes failing to mention the security update, but instead focusing on the ability to see stickers in full size.  However I think that users are far more likely to install the update if they are getting shiny stickers, and we've seen Apple doing the same thing, packaging new emoji's with security updates because they know it gets a higher and faster install rate for their users.\r\n\r\nFinally, despite the reporting in the mainstream media (Radio 4 I'm looking at you), it's worth remembering that this was just a first stage exploit.  Whoever was using it is then able to execute code, as the WhatsApp process on your phone.  That might enable stealing your whatsapp history, but to establish a permanent compromise of the phone, and to access information in other applications, they would have to have a second stage that included a privilege escalation on the phone itself.

Whenever you conduct a cyber attack, there is a high likelihood that the victim will eventually notice, and that they'll conduct forensics to work out how you got in and what you did.\r\n\r\nThe most advanced attackers, such as Equation Group, tend to clean up after themselves, leaving no trace of the tools, or as little as possible.  But if you attack a target that is under surveillance, then the opponent is quite likely to catch the exploit in action.\r\n\r\nInside advanced intelligence agencies, compartmentalisation ensures that often the attacks that they have available to them, they don't tell their own defending teams in unclassified environments about those vulnerabilities, because that would tip off that there are known issues (and often, there may be no good defence since they haven't told the supplier).  Therefore catching an attack in progress and understanding how it works and building your own tooling to exploit it is highly likely to work effectively.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a classic case of an enemy catching a vulnerability and promptly throwing it back.  Given that APT3, Buckeye, is the group named in the 2017 indictment of 3 chinese operatives working for a \"purported internet security firm\", this is a good view into the cut and thrust of international cyber espionage at work.",

From [WhatsApp](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/05/whatsapp-vulnerability-exploited-to-infect-phones-with-israeli-spyware/), to [vulnerabilities in the linux kernel](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-kernel-prior-to-508-vulnerable-to-remote-code-execution/), [hardware](https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/14/intel-zombieload-vulnerability-mac/), [Windows](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2019/05/14/prevent-a-worm-by-updating-remote-desktop-services-cve-2019-0708/) and [Cisco products](https://thrangrycat.com/) and I'm sure I've forgotten some others already.\r\n\r\nOf course, us enlightened security professionals like to tell people, \"Just patch, it's the single best thing you can do\".  And it's true, it is the right advice, but we sometimes say that it is basic advice, as if patching is the easiest thing in the world.\r\n\r\nBut our contexts differ massively. If you run a set of docker containers in a cloud providers managed Kubernetes cluster, then the way that you patch and the impact of applying a patch is significantly different to if you run an industrial control system.\r\n\r\nWhile it's easy to wave at the two ends of the patch complexity spectrum, it's also harder when we talk about just different forms of Corporate IT.  This week, [a major RDP big was announced and patched by Microsoft](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2019/05/14/prevent-a-worm-by-updating-remote-desktop-services-cve-2019-0708/).  Everyone, [including the NCSC](https://twitter.com/NCSC/status/1129479583517036544), are telling you to patch your IT.  But what if this patch included something that broke for your users, say, [a faulty update to the HSTS header that breaks many gov.uk domains](https://www.ghacks.net/2019/05/17/latest-windows-10-updates-break-access-to-some-uk-government-websites/)?  Should you patch to prevent what is still just a potential worm, and guarantee breaking your users web browsing experience?\r\n\r\nWhat about patching your sharepoint instances, or your cisco infrastructure?  How easy is it to apply those patches and not accidentally cut off traffic to some important devices?  \r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, one can decide to roll out patches to the most critical servers without having to roll them out to all servers, or you can direct patches to a core set of users and test that the patch works and applies correctly before rolling it out to more users.  But who should be part of your testing cohort?  Maybe IT should have the update rolled out first, so they get the pain and disruption, but that means that they also always have the newest and shiniest tools, maybe they should be left to last?  Making these decisions requires people, requires the space to think and make these decisions, and that's not easy to find in most organisations.\r\n\r\nIt's easy for us to say that patching is the basics, but that doesn't mean it's easy, simple or trivial to do.  It does however remain probably the most effective security intervention you can make.\r\n\r\nIn other news, this is the 52nd edition of CyberWeekly, meaning that I've been writing these newsletters for a year now.  It's been very therapeutic and valuable for me to sit and write on a regular basis, and I hope that you find it at least half as interesting and useful to read.

I don't think that this is terribly surprising, that the location of the cyber offensive team is a valid military target given that they were a military team operating in a militarised environment.\r\n\r\nThere's a set of thinking about what makes a valid military target that can follow from this.  Do we think that the NSA's Fort Meade would be a legitimate target of war?  Lots of people there wear fatigues on a regular basis and it is a military base after all.  The reason we don't think about it is that cyber attacks are carried out at a distance.  Mostly, we don't worry that Ft Meade, or the Donut, or other intelligence buildings are a target because they are far away, and most of the major military actors don't have missiles, bombers or other technology that can reach such a target unimpeded.\r\n\r\nBut out in the theatre of war between two states, some intelligence operatives do their jobs, intercepting enemy lines of communication and applying the intelligence product to advise friendly troops appropriately.  We generally don't have an issue with the idea that they would be valid targets during war, so why was this tweet such an issue?\r\n\r\nThe unanswered question that this lies on us is exactly what level of military intervention is acceptable or appropriate if we do decide that offensive cyber operation teams within military units are valid targets.  Can cyber force only be responded to with cyber force, or will next time we see a major player using cyber force on a major western nation will we see a military intervention as a response?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, most of us who work in cybersecurity are not part of the armed forces, and would not consider ourselves valid military targets, but this event reminds us that for military thinkers, cyber is just another domain of warfare, and that they are happy with the militarisation of the field.",

In the other cases, the binaries were recent (from the end of 2018). The malicious code was not inserted as a resource, neither did it overwrite the unused zero-filled space inside the programs. Instead, it seems to have been neatly compiled into the program, and in most cases, it starts at the beginning of the code section as if it had been added even before the legitimate code. Even the data with the encrypted payload is stored inside this code section. This indicates that the attackers either had access to the source code of the victim\u2019s projects or injected malware on the premises of the breached companies at the time of project compilation.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nIn late 2018, we found a suspicious sample of the link.exe tool uploaded to a public malware scanning service. The tool is part of Microsoft Visual Studio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) used for creating applications for Microsoft Windows. The same user also uploaded digitally signed compromised executables and some of the backdoors used in the same campaign.\r\n\r\nThe attack is comprised of an infected Microsoft Incremental Linker, a malicious DLL module that gets loaded through the compromised linker. The malicious DLL then hooks the file open operation and redirects attempts to open a commonly used C++ runtime library during the process of static linking. The redirect destination is a malicious .lib file, which gets linked with the target software instead of the legitimate library. The code also carefully checks which executable is being linked and applies file redirection only if the name matches the hardcoded target file name.",

As a platform provider, what is your threat model, is it the aggregate of all your consumers, and how does it change as you onboard each new consumer.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it\u2019s increasingly hard to give good transitive assurances for the security of any platform play.  Primarily because we lack the language, but also because it\u2019s so easy to make false statements about the security of a system and never be caught out for it.

But that also paints a big target on those organisations backs.  They're the most studied, and you can get \"Techniques, Tools and Procedures\" descriptions for various groups operating out of Iran, China, Russia and North Korea, meaning that if you are a small operating team in a much smaller country, it is probably worth while trying to emulate those TTP's as much as possible.  Everyone is happy and willling to believe that attacks came from those organisations anyway and probably won't dig much further.\r\n\r\nBut small hacking organisations, whether criminal in nature, single issue motivated groups or loose hacker collectives, are all growing in capability, and sad to say, but attacking capability is becoming more accessible to amateurs far faster than defensive capability is being made available to the rest of us.  This means that we are going to see more and more increases in the number and type of attacks that are of growing complexity.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, if everyone is being hit by the same high complexity attacks, that makes the use of threat intelligence, information sharing and indicators of compromise far more useful, so the value of those as defensive tools will also grow at the same time.\r\n\r\nI think my view was best summed up by [this tweet this week](https://twitter.com/pmelson/status/864866972839837698).  What matters most is not who attacked you or what country flag they were flying, real or false, but whether you were able to detect and stop the attack before it caused damage",

One can only assume that they did so because they disapproved of the decision and want public discourse to push against this decision before it was made public and while it can still be changed.\r\n\r\nThe anger inside Government about this leak is palpable in the reporting on it, but there are some interesting questions about this as a leak.

That's a very different type of activity, and it's interesting to see what the US thinks.\r\n\r\nSome curious things are in this report however. Generally, when you read lots of commercial reports, 4 countries come out as the major players in cyber attacks, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.  Of those 4, there's been a lot talked about North Korea as an actor conducting financial criminal attacks in order to get money around the trade sanctions that affect the country.  However, this report only lists 3 countries as the primary actors, Russia, China and Iran.  I think this is because the report focuses on economic theft that is \"second order\", that is to say theft of intellectual property, US trade secrets and military and civilian technologies, all of which are implied to be given to state sponsored firms in order to help them compete on the world stage.  North Korea has generally been accused of being more blatant than that, and doesn't really attempt to compete economically.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this report talks about future technologies and the risks that they bring.  It however confuses some of the terms and I suspect that the authors are not technical enough to really understand what cloud computing is, or how it relates to the \"Internet of Things\".  The claim that the IoT and AI will create billions of unsecured network nodes is an interesting one because it has no real relevance to the economic espionage that they are talking about.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's a small note in here: \"The solidification of cloud computing over the past decade as a global information industry standard, coupled with the deployment of technologies such as AI and IoT, will introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities to U.S. networks.\", which I think is to suggest that attackers are more easily able to construct deniable operational infrastructure for cyber campaigns and tear it down fairly easily.  This combined with what I've heard repeatedly recently about \"AI enabled attackers\" clearly worries defenders a lot.",

GCHQ's HCSEC exists to provide technical assurance of telecommunications equipment, and clearly there are a lot of people worried about this stuff, but the reality of our modern world, we can and should be worrying about the supply chain of all hardware (as the infamous Super Micro story by bloomberg highlighted\"), or the supply chain of our software (as I write this, news that Docker Hub has had a breach has pinged past me).  This obsession with flag of origin really does belie the real complexities of the situation and the complexities of the geopolitics at play.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting statements at CyberUK to me was in the last session of the conference, in the Future Threats session.  An audience member asked the question whether the centralisation of hosting onto a small number of cloud providers was going to create a huge risk.  The answer, from Kris McConkey, Threat Detection & Response Lead Partner at PwC, was that the major cloud providers had some of the best security engineers in the world, and that they had built systems that were far more secure than any previous generation of hosting environments.  Kris pointed out that our telecommunication providers had some of the oldest and nastiest legacy systems in the world, and that we should be far more worried about the security of those companies than the modern cloud companies.  \r\n\r\nThe risks in cloud come not from the cloud environments themselves, but from how we use cloud environments, from poor password hygiene, lack of second factors and poor cloud security capabilities.  We are still shockingly bad at agreeing the basics of being a secure user of cloud computing, primarily because the term cloud computing is so vague as to not mean anything, but also because too many people were sold the idea that the cloud is just someone else's datacenter, and we know how to secure a network in someone else's data center.",

I hope you enjoyed it, and it was novel to wake up on a Saturday morning and be able to read the newsletter rather than having to check and write it!\r\n\r\nDNS is probably the most important technology on the web today, and pun firmly intended, the root of many of our cybersecurity for many organisations.\r\n\r\nComputers verify who they are talking to by using DNS to lookup the IP address, but they also compare the DNS names to the TLS certificates, and one can even use tools like LetsEncrypt to issue new TLS certificates if you control the DNS for a site.  Control of DNS gives an attacker the ability to control or intercept almost everything in the system.\r\n\r\nThis makes DNS companies a huge target for both advanced and simple attackers.  Of course, things like SeaTurtle show us that nation state level advanced actors are attempting to breach the management of root servers, of DNS registrars themselves as a way of attacking organisations that might have great security measures themselves.\r\n\r\nThis stuff is really hard to secure, because it is by necessity a supply chain where you need to trust another organisation.  Registrars might have good internal security, but often don't offer that security to their customers.  How many registrars support 2FA for the DNS admin for clients?  How many provide out of band notification of changes? How many are able to support their customers into using strong passwords and secure by design tooling to manage their DNS entries?\r\n\r\nWith a background of the sorts of attacks that we see nation states conducting (as per the Mueller report, the Estonian Security Services and so forth), you can see that the main difference between a nation state and an independent hacking group is simply money and attention, and that gap is being lowered constantly.

Often when you read policies, you can almost chart the different incidents and near-misses that organisations and the author have experienced, with mitigations for these events being codified into the policies.\r\n\r\nWorst yet, the policies can often be written in pseudo-legalese - presumably based on an implicit belief that this is a serious document, and serious documents need serious words, and that if it's simple no one will take it seriously. But, if it's not simple, no one will understand it, and if no one understands it, then they definitely won't follow it, and if they're not following it, why are you bothering to write it?\r\n\r\nI (Jon) had a conversation with a security person recently where they openly admitted that their organisation's security policies were confusing, but that this was 'ok' because it meant that if someone did something wrong then the policies would 'probably cover what they did and we can get them for it'. What a horrible way to think of your staff, and what a terrible way to help them to be secure!\r\n\r\nThis sample policy shows that you can make information security easy to understand, without losing any of the important and serious details.

Michael has kindly let us edit Cyber Weekly again this week (thanks for having us 'stay' a little longer Michael).\r\n\r\nThe theme we have chosen for this week is 'People & Privacy'.\r\n\r\nSince the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) came about (made 2016, implemented May 2018) there has been a stronger link between data protection legislation _compliance_, cyber security (information security in general such as encryption) and user-centric _privacy_.\r\n\r\nWhile most would generally agree that privacy is a good thing, we often see both ends of the spectrum at the same time: 'rookie mistakes' leading to breaches/fines and over-compliance where organisations take a risk-averse interpretation and send out an email asking people to confirm they are\u2026 still happy to receive emails.\r\n\r\nThis week we gather stories that bring technology, people and privacy together (often ending in fireworks).\r\n\r\nThis is our second and final week here at Cyber Weekly! We'll be back to your regular scheduled programming with Michael from next week.\r\n\r\n[Jon](https://twitter.com/JonPLawrence) & [Joel](https://twitter.com/JoelGSamuel).",

The problem we are faced with today is not a filter bubble, it's a decision bubble.\r\n\r\nSo already here, we can see how differently we really need to approach this. You can't fix this by trying to show people more information from more sources. Instead, we need to approach this in terms of why these decisions happen in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to approach this in two ways. There is one approach for people who are already convinced by something that isn't true, and then there is another approach for normal people who haven't been 'converted' yet.\r\n\r\nSo let's talk about the people who have already decided to believe something that isn't true.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to realize is that we cannot fix this by telling them that they are wrong. They already know this and they have just chosen not to believe it. No amount of 'fact-checking' is ever going to change that.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to do instead is to figure out why they made the decision to think this way in the first place.",

            "intro": "While the debate about the geopolitical implications of Huawei software managing western 5G networks continues on, we really should be worrying about how secure is the software that manages... well everything.\r\n\r\nWe rely, in this day and age, on software to manage pretty much everything, from firmware updates on our computer, operating systems, wordpress themes, airplanes and self driving cars.  Software is behind a huge amount of these things, and the bad news for us all, is that much of it is badly written, poorly tested and of dubious provenance.\r\n\r\nWhile I still believe that patching early and patching often is the most useful cyber security control that you can apply in almost any circumstance, we have to acknowledge that patching mechanisms aren't necessarily safe, and that we have to get our updates from somewhere.\r\n\r\nWhile those of us who do cybersecurity on a regular basis are arguing about the exact best configuration of PKI, CA assertions and update mechanisms, far more people will be installing wordpress themes into their blogs or other far less trusted code, and it's hard to get individuals to care about this kind of problem, because if it doesn't negatively affect them, then there's little to no cost to running untrusted software.\r\n\r\nAs software gets more complex, this problem is only going to get harder.  I was in a session at a conference yesterday where the discussion of testing the provenance and security of containers was raised, and while there were some interesting ideas, essentially most people shrugged and simply expressed that you had to trust the major projects of building valid and acceptable containers.  It looks like, even when you have smart people in a room, the general consensus is \"Supply chains are hard\".  Worse still, I think it's perceived as being \"not a fun problem\" to solve and so everyone would just rather get on with solving their business problems instead.",

You are in pitched armed conflict with nation states and it\u2019s cyber war!\r\n\r\nBut the reality of cyber security is that we are our own worst enemy over half the time, with data breaches being caused by misconfigurarion (such as logging passwords) or fat fingers where people accidentally email out personal data. \r\n\r\nThe other attacks are the drive by attacks. A report, which I shan\u2019t link to avoid giving it more publicity, claimed more than 86m \u201ccyber attacks\u201d in a year for a large government site. This can not possibly be true unless they are counting every single port scan from the internet, or anytime anything looks even slightly suspicious. \r\n\r\nBut like the attack on Hydro, sometimes these aren\u2019t \u201ctargeted attacks\u201d. In the same way that if someone steals your phone from your pocket in a busy city Center, the chances that they know you personally, that they will guess your pin code is your date of birth is really quite slim. Instead many attacks are attacks of opportunity, malware where they found a victim and the identity of the victim doesn\u2019t really matter. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, if we raise the bar of protection against these low level, untargetted attacks, we make it harder for targeted attacks as well.

It's really good to have an open source tool that delivers in the same area, has some weight behind it, and will continue to evolve.  This should push IDAPro to add features or capabilities that demonstrate the value and worth.\r\nThe fact that it's free makes it far easier for hobbyists, amateurs and people who want to get into the industry, get the tool and use it.  This isn't a cut down, half featured free tool, it's actually really good and used within the NSA for malware analysis amongst other things.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the constant battle to get software open sourced is often held up by security people claiming that security tooling and security related code cannot be released.  This is an active operational tool, used by the NSA.  Any bugs found in it, could in theory be exploited on NSA Analysts computers (if you can get code there!  Good luck).  If the NSA can open source this, then it's a good challenge to other teams around the world that their code/systems etc aren't \"as secure as the NSA's\".

I know and understand a lot of the theory, and I've been on web application hacking courses, played at a few Cybergames, and while I don't come first, I don't do terribly.\r\n\r\nBut hacking tools fascinate me because it's an entire industry of tooling, of software development, that has very different use cases, users and coding requirements to enterprise software or web applications.\r\n\r\nI wish more hacking tooling was automatable, and that was one of the things among many that made my ears prick up at the NSA releasing Ghidra.\r\n\r\nWhen it was released there was a lot of noise on twitter about the fact that when run in debug mode, it opened a port that enabled someone to remotely control the software and because it includes a shell, the machine itself.  This was seen as a security flaw, or a deliberate backdoor into the software.  But I think huge numbers of penetration testers and \"hackers\" work alone, they don't work in teams, and they don't understand the need for tools that can be scripted, that can be remotely controlled and can be put on shared infrastructure.  Whether that was the case for this issue is another matter, but Ghidra specifically calls out that it is designed to be used by teams.\r\n\r\nI've had a bunch of other links to tools hanging around for a while, and I was unsure whether or not to include them.  These are either tools that got released that I liked the look off, or something I use when playing at hacking contests.  They're included here because I've found them useful both in practice, but often as a way to get a better understanding of bits of computer security that I don't understand properly.\r\n\r\nI hope you find them useful, and if you would like to see more tools included as part of this newsletter, then please let me know via email or twitter, and feel free to send me tools you think are worth pointing out, as I run across a lot less of them than I do interesting articles.\r\n\r\nAlso, finally, I made mention of bridges collapsing last week, that's because there was an article about it that I forgot to include in the links. Doh!  It's an interesting off topic article, and so I've included it this week, just so it makes a bit more sense.",

I'd had in mind to do something about how the law affects the internet, but there were just too many good stories this week, especially the absolutely excellent writeup by Recorded Future about chinese activity in influence operations.\r\n\r\nAs the article says, there's a decided difference between an influence operation and an information manipulation operation. States have for centuries conducted various forms of propaganda operations, both abroad, and often on their own citizens. We have an in built assumption that western democratic states don't lie to their citizens, but TV shows and great movies have been made about the Art of Spin, and the ability of the media to highlight certain facts and hide others.\r\n\r\nWe view information manipulation as harmful distortion of facts, and that's a good line to draw in the sand. Unfortunately, while the focus is on hostile states conducting such operations, whether in the UK, the US or elsewhere, western democracy is quite capable of protecting and encouraging it's own citizens with free speech to spread harmful misinformation itself. That tension between the freedom to speak ones mind against the state versus the ability to spread harmful misinformation about vaccines and their relation to autism is a tough tension for a democratic society to live with. Is the casual spread of disinformation the cost of having free speech?\r\n\r\nAs with the reason for bridges collapsing, I think the low level of misinformation is probably an acceptable cost, but the sudden creation of amplifiers, in social networks, in group chat and the ability to spread your views much further and wider than was possible even just a decade ago. We've created harmful feedback mechanisms that simply exacerbate the damage and we don't have good dampeners to reduce that harmful feedback cycle yet.",

The big difference now, especially with RSA this week, is all of those hardware dongles that you get given for free by vendors.

Any actual intrusions (as opposed to online trolling and propaganda) are almost certain to have occurred months before Election Day; it seems much more likely that the thwarted Russian activity, if there was any, would have taken the form of an influence campaign rather than \u201cincursions.\u201d But drawing any conclusions about which of the three possibilities I describe based on public information\u00a0 is impossible.

Operations used to think that as a community.  Classical operations teams simply considered the cloud data center to be just another data center, but with some weird extra bits around the outside, you could no longer pull cables out, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, when a product evolves from being a simple componentized product to being something you buy like a utility, the practice of managing that product has to significantly evolve as well.  Cloud infrastructure isn't just computers in someone else's data center, to name a witty but wrong sticker, it's so much more than that, because it's a paradigmatic leap into a new way of thinking about computers, from pets to cattle, from simple servers to complicated systems.\r\n\r\nSecurity thinking really hasn't evolved along the same lines yet, or not well.  Instead many security departments, often the department of fires, is so busy reacting to things that they haven't been involved, but they haven't been able to look to the future and understand what has gone on.  And so they make the same requests of delivery teams and operational teams that they always have.  \"Is the data encrypted at rest?\".  But in a cloud infrastructure, the question is actually really hard to ask.  In our physical data center, we have some concept of \"at rest\", a spinning disk that we can point at and say \"our database is on that\".  But cloud infrastructure has the bits packaged up and sent all over the data center.  When is it at rest? Who can access those disks and what would it mean to? Where are the encryption keys stored?\r\n\r\nIn order to take advantage of the cloud, to build future proof cloud solutions that take advantage of the nature of the cloud, we need to find a new set of practices, a set of security practices that have evolved along with cloud infrastructure, that are aligned with how it works, and that understand where the fault lines actually are.  Because if we don't do that, then we are just fighting the war of yesterday against the enemy of tomorrow.",

We did well, growing to over 60 people at last count before I left, and were considered a high performing team who collaborated and never said no. People enjoyed working with us and we took on more and more work and constantly delivered.\r\n\r\nThe cost though was an intense environment where my main role was PowerPoint and politics, and constant air support for the team. Combine a tough travel schedule and the global, always on element, I never truly switched off. That said, one of my mottos was \u201cWork Hard, Play Hard\u201d so evenings with teams, internal clients and their customers in different countries were long, hilarious and helped us bond even closer to perform even better. Frankly it was exhausting and my sleep suffered.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to close this with a call to action. This isn\u2019t some virtue signalling programme that I will front up on Twitter and Facebook, but rather a call for everyone to include mental health topics in their team meetings, their management reports and metrics, as well as face to face meetings. The financial losses to our industry are probably staggering because of mental health issues, so we should be tracking and probing on it in our organisations as much as gender or racial diversity.",

If you ask that at a DevOps or Agile conference, people will either stare at you blankly, or tell you horror stories of their experiences with CAB.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of one organisation that had a weekly CAB for any change going to production.  It was done by email, but the CAB terms meant that every change had to have positive response from all board members to be allowed to go into production.  There was over 30 members on the board, and so a simple single line change to an NginX config file required positive approval from all of them.\r\n\r\nBut in agile, we tend to look at existing systems and say \"these don't meet our needs\", and then throw them away and start afresh.  And that's a good thing, sometimes your need revolution not evolution.  But we also get hoisted by our own petard, and we start to believe that anything that we didn't invent, anything that came before must necessarily be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the Cynefin (pronounced Kah-Nef-In) framework, which has a set of plays for dealing with environments in different ways depending on the inherent complexity, repeatability and knowability of the context or environment.  In essence it reminds us that \"agile\" is great for dealing with environments that are inherently unknowable, or unknown to us, but that where environments are well known and well understood, we can be far more effective with a good plan.  Agile projects that I've worked on tend to start in an unknowable domain, but as they mature, we do tend to discover most of the information about the domain that we need to know, and we start repeating the same plays, the same actions that we've done before.  ITIL has a bad reputation because it's badly implemented in a lot of places, and because it's designed to manage change in a knowable environment.  \r\n\r\nSome environments constantly change around us, and good agile practitioners know when to use the sensing toolsets that allow them to probe an environment versus the planning and doing toolsets that allow them to manage work that has an element of unpredictability to it.\r\n\r\nThe launch of NHSX is an exciting opportunity to see people taking some of the principles and plays that we've seen work with GDS, and apply them to a new context, one where they don't know the domain as well.  However, the teams are going to have to try to understand the value of what is already being done there, and to remember that sometimes the bad things are being done for good reasons.  We shouldn't simply throw away everything that went before, but must be humble, introspective and ask those who have been around and experienced it before to explain the history, the purposes and the often forgotten reasons behind the existing edifices.",

Our data shows that 46% of companies with at least one developer tool also have G Suite, vs. only 17% of non-developers.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has long established itself as a workplace necessity, and thus has its fair share of loyal users.

This hasn\u2019t come true generally, probably a combination of developers having a myopic view of users (developers love to build for other developers, but struggle to remember that many users don\u2019t care about the same things that they do), and the fact that while technology has advanced, most businessiness don\u2019t take advantage of the power of developers.\r\n\r\nStephens\u2019s main point was that developers have a unique combination of skills, the ability to see and understand how technology works, and their ability to actively make changes to software, to build systems that can take advantage of the world around them.  \r\n\r\nI was reminded of this reading the little nugget in the Okta IT survey that showed that organisations that had Developers in them were significantly more likely to use Google\u2019s G-Suite.  I know that most of the developers I talk to prefer G-Suite over Office 365, but I\u2019ve never stopped to wonder why that is, and what that might mean.  I suspect that in many organisations around the world, the developers are also the ones who use the most \u201cshadow IT\u201d, the ones who want to use various SaaS tools and systems.  Is this just because developers are used to using a variety of small tools to do a job, or is there something about the usage of standard corporate tools that turns off developers?\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting in your organisations to try to understand what tools your developers use, and would prefer to use, and try to understand why that is.",

You want this Business Agility magic you keep hearing about but you don\u2019t want to, or are unable to, challenge the corporate funding and governance processes, and whatever you do has to fit within strict departmental cost controls. So you start by sending a handful of project managers for Scrum Master certification, and maybe some business analysts for Product Owner training, then you try Scrum for a bit. Later you might try Scrum-of-Scrums, SAFe, LeSS, or similar with the best of intentions. If you can just to prove it works in a contained pilot environment, the rest of the organisation will surely wake up and beat a path to your door!\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this kind of transformation requires a fundamental shift in how people think and how they operate. This in turn requires acknowledging that the way they are running things is based on assumptions and constraints that are no longer relevant to the modern business environment; that they are still in business in spite of, rather than because of, these inherited management and governance systems. No one likes to acknowledge that, even to themselves. Their subconscious minds vehemently resist this paradigm shift, which makes them easy prey for a vendor selling a product that promises said transformation while conveniently fitting their existing paradigm.\r\n\r\nThe vendors and consultants can do this regardless of whether it will deliver the results, safe in the knowledge they and their methods won\u2019t be held accountable if it doesn\u2019t, because the one thing everyone can agree on is that transformation is hard and at least we tried. Many proponents of these methods have a religiosity about them. Their method works; if you don\u2019t believe this you are misguided, misinformed, or just antagonistic (I\u2019ve been accused of all three); and if it doesn\u2019t work then you are applying it incorrectly.",

How do you get budget for that project that makes sense and how do you engage with the organisational governance models?  \"Just trust me\" generally isn't acceptable as a governance model, and yet it tends to be the one that agile teams push for.\r\n\r\nThe hardest parts about digital transformation is around the organisational borders of the teams trying this stuff.  It's when the team needs a budget, approval to spend, approval to operate.  Lots of bits of the organisation are focused on providing solutions for the old way of working, but the organisation might rely on those solutions existing, and you need some way to jury rig the outputs of your agile program to look satisfactory to the bureaucracy, but not to strangle your digital transformation programme and prevent it working.\r\n\r\nSecurity is just one of those strangleholds, but it tends to be a significant one, because security people really dislike risk, and any transformation project is about taking risks.  Security teams that are there to enable the organisation to take risks, and see their role as highlighting the risks and offering use risk mitigation advice will do better here than security teams who see their role as mitigating the risks themselves.",

For those who don\u2019t know fortnight, it\u2019s a pretty simple first person shooter that is designed for fast constant matches.  The basic gameplay is 100 to 1, where 100 players start by flying over the island, and it\u2019s everyone versus everyone until just a single person remains.  If you die, you can join another match within seconds, which creates for fast fun gameplay.\r\n\r\nBut the environment is something else.  The island is the same for all players, but it kind of constantly changes.  Epic Games have been telling stories through Fortnight that everyone logged in at the same time can globally participate in.  The ending of the last \u201cseason\u201d saw a massive global change to the island, but if you were logged in and playing a match at that time, you literally saw the lightning striking bits of the ground and changing the terrain.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to this story.  This is a digital world, it can be changed in seconds by computers without the slightest thought.  But if you go and play today, you\u2019ll see that the football field has a stage that is mid construction.

Right after the briefing ended, she said she was told she had just received a cover story.\r\n\r\nShe then received the \u201cBlack briefing,\u201d a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.

We sometimes think that bureaucratic systems such as filling forms to request work done is something that slows us down and prevents communication, and often it is.  But it's also important to the organisation to know what work is actually happening and where the blockers to flow actually are, and without any form of paper trail, it's difficult to know who requested what.\r\n\r\nBureaucracy is also absolutely necessary when you start scaling your organisation.  If you have one team delivering a product, then consistency comes from the teams natural communication pathways.  But if you are overseeing even 8 or 10 delivery teams within an organisation, then you'll see that the teams themselves often fail to communicate, and lack consistency.  We shouldn't all be exactly the same cookie cutter team structure and decisions, but consistency in choice helps us deliver at speed because we can start to take advantage of shared platforms, shared practices and economies of scale.\r\n\r\nWe need to think about the minimum viable bureaucracy, and we need to find some way of taking the 10,000 feet view of the organisation and making it apparent to teams, so they can see why they might need to raise that thing by a ticket, or take a certain type of decision to a more senior decision maker.",

If you are running a security team and you start putting in these automated scanning tools (of which Veracode just happen to sell one of), then you are going to create more work for your development team.\r\n\r\nYou can't just start raising an order of magnitude more work for your development teams unless they are capable of receiving and acting upon that work, and they can't receive and act on that work unless they can deploy the changes into production.\r\n\r\nIt's very akin to the issue of bug bounties.  As [Katie Moussouris](https://twitter.com/@k8em0) has said repeatedly and loudly, just creating a bug bounty program won't fix your security bugs, it's not just free pen testing.  Before you can create a bug bounty program, you need to be able to triage the bugs, allocate them to the right teams and have them fixed and deployed quickly.  Otherwise it's just wasting everyones time.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's worth noting from the State of Software Security report, that organisations that are capable of scanning hundreds of times per year rather than once or twice, also correlate with organisations that fix the most flaws.  The stat they quote is that they fix flaws 11.5 times faster than the norm.",

The move to cloud infrastructure has been both faster and slower than many of us expected, but the adoption of cloud practices has lagged a long way behind the technology.  Modern cloud native systems don't build large networks, and they don't trust the network to keep their data safe.  Instead we see zero trust networking, systems that are configured to encrypt everything from point to point, and identity as the core security model for systems.  But security teams themselves haven't been able to keep up with the technological changes, and so we see organisations failing to adopt good security practices in the cloud, and trying to fit an older model of security to a totally different domain.\r\n\r\nIt's this stuff that makes me think that patching in the cloud is likely to get worse before it gets better.  Because the cloud gives such capability to automate and improve the ability to patch the operating system (just roll a new VM with a new image, bring it up blue-green style and see if it works), but to do that you need to have adopted the cloud native way of building systems.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the identity of cloud administrators is a core concept that didn't really exist.  Previously, your admins used desktop computers on a privileged network, and the admin password could be \"password1\" or \"admin\" because nobody could ever get onto your management network.  But today, cloud portals are much harder to lock down, and admin accounts are far more powerful.  Good cloud services offer ways to escalate your privileges when needed, or assume roles as needed, all in audited ways that make stealing and using an \"admin account\" much harder.  But many organisations just aren't using that technology.\r\n\r\nI think 2019 will be categorised by more breaches, mostly through insufficient configuration, not patching systems and increasingly through the stealing or takeover of cloud credentials.\r\n\r\nOn that happy note, I hope you are enjoying January so far, and looking forward to payday after a long month.

In particular, while I was pushing back against the idea that the field of cybersecurity is warfare, I'm not trying to minimise that there are some advanced adversaries out there who are organised, well trained and and have specific targets in mind.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine likened the analogy to physical protection.  Tesco's UK worries about casual theives shoplifting from their stores by using security guards, and they worry about more organised groups attempting to steal the cash by using safes and limited cash floats and so forth.  Technically they should worry about intercontinental balistic missiles that can destroy the store, but in reality, there is little they can do against it, and investing in defenses is not worth it.  In cyber security we have a tendancy thanks to marketing to worry primarily about the top end, about the advanced cyber adversaries before we worry about putting in security guards and safes.  My argument is that we should be doing the basics right before we get too het up about intelligent capable adversaries.  \r\n\r\nHowever, Nick has a point, which is that the gap between basic cyber attack and advanced cyber attack doesn't feel very high at the moment.  Groups like MageCart are able to carry out quite advanced attacks, ones that we might have purported to be nationstate a few years ago, while seemingly being a small set of criminal gangs with limited resources and capability.",

The goal is to take advantage of existing the weaknesses in the identity management systems of group chat and calling systems. This would allow law enforcement \u2014 with the participation of the service provider \u2014 to add a \u201cghost user\u201d (or in some cases, a \u201cghost device\u201d) to an existing group chat or calling session. In systems where group membership can be modified by the provider infrastructure, this could mostly be done via changes to the server-side components of the provider\u2019s system.\n\nI say that it could\u00a0mostly be done server-side, because there\u2019s a wrinkle. Even if you modify the provider infrastructure to add unauthorized users to a conversation, most existing E2E systems do notify users when a new participant (or device) joins a conversation. Generally speaking, having a stranger wander into your conversation is a great way to notify criminals that the game\u2019s afoot or what have you, so you\u2019ll absolutely want to block this warning.\n\nWhile the GCHQ proposal doesn\u2019t go into great detail, it seems to follow that any workable proposal will require providers to\u00a0suppress those warning messages at the target\u2019s device.

This was what the news seemed to scream at me this week with the release of the modlishka tool.\r\n\r\nAs I've said repeatedly, many times, the most effective cyber security defense you can employ right now is 2FA.  The reason is that it moves attackers from harvesting credentials and using them later to having to perform an online attack and immediately deploy some feature to let themselves back in.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the [timeline for the OPM hack](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/) the attackers found a credential and then came back during the long 4th of July weekend to seed their backdoor and get it working.  If that credential had required 2FA and the attackers didn't have access to generating it, then that later attack wouldn't have been possible, instead the attackers would have had to rush through with a session hijacking attack, which is noisier, easier to detect and in their rush they would have been more likely to make a mistake.\r\n\r\nSecurity experts have always known that 2FA is not perfect, it's just a lot better than not having it.  However there is still a sense of absolutism, of black and white in cybersecurity matters.  Security policies and procedures are analysed by \"security experts\" and either declared useless or brilliant, with very little grading in between.\r\n\r\nI sometimes complain about next generation firewall products and \"advanced threat protection\" products.  I do this not because I think these aren't good products (although some do have far better marketing than capabilities), but because in general network security barriers in normal firewalls are \"good enough\" and the same money would be better spent elsewhere.",

They don\u2019t, and cannot, show capability or competence.  I got my CISSP and I don\u2019t think it shows a terribly high bar, because exams are always about learning for the exam.  It shows that someone can pass an exam, not that they know this stuff in the slightest (and in fact, knowing the subject areas well is a disadvantage for CISSP because the reality is far more complex than the CISSP exam expects, and you have to learn what the \u201cCISSP\u201d answer is, because \u201cit depends\u201d isn\u2019t on the multiple choice selection).\r\n\r\nBut I disagree here with Perry that security professionals must know how to program.  Even his focus on a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is more of an issue only in certain older languages, shows that the knowledge is specific and not always correct in the field. \r\n\r\nInformation security, Cyber security, Privacy and Law are all areas within computer security, and not all of them require people to be genius programmers.  There is a value to learning how software is built, to learning how this stuff works, but it\u2019s also equally important that security professionals know about psychology, social signals, economics and incentives as the hard computer science stuff.  By focusing on whether your CISO can program, you are focussed entirely on the wrong thing. ",

Now we can\u2019t easily detect insider malicious behaviour from that, but general studies imply that actively malicious insider behaviour is pretty rare generally.  \r\n\r\nThis means that if these numbers are accurate, then we aren\u2019t at war with advanced \u201ccyber-adversaries\u201d whatever that means, but that we are at war with ourselves, with the software that we build, and with the processes that encourage error, misconfiguration and accident.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at the safety processes and principles, and the way that people work in safety critical systems, and they have the same problem, assuming that users are tired, over worked and stressed and liable to make mistakes, not follow process, or misconfigure things.  I think for me, 2019 will be about focusing on what we can learn from safety engineering, from healthy retrospective behaviours, and how we can build systems that are resistant to misconfiguration or accident.\r\n\r\nWe still have a long way to go in security as well, but given that there\u2019s an average time of 196 days to detect a breach (and around 5 years for the Marriott breach), and somewhere around 40 days to patch many vulnerabilities (but with a massive error bar on that data), I still think that the best security strategy is to focus on identifying your assets, ensuring they are regularly and easily patched, and then focusing on blocking incoming phishing emails.  Almost all of the more advanced cyber security products and things are of massively reducing value after that compared to dealing with the other half of data breaches",

In reality, it's the security side of the relationship ignoring how painful it can be. Telling users to turn every security feature on without tackling the friction users have to experience makes security adoption even less likely. We need to look at security as a flow, as a process, and not as a set of unrelated instances or events.\" *\r\n\r\nThis is so important. Security teams discussing the use of things like multi-factor authenticators need to consider what the friction is on the user, and need to take a realistic assessment of the risk.  We shouldn't just add a 2FA on every account we use online, the usability impact is too high right now.\r\n\r\n### [Revenge of the PMO | Silicon Valley Product Group](https://svpg.com/revenge-of-the-pmo/)\r\n\r\n*\"I can\u2019t imagine any of the strong tech product companies I know choosing to move to SAFe, and if for some reason they did, I\u2019m pretty certain their top talent would leave.\"*\r\n\r\nStrong words from Marty Cagan on the Scaled Agile Framework. This is my experience as well, organisations trying to do agile at scale miss that self empowered teams who can self direct is the entire point of agile.  Security people often seem to be scared of this as well, and I suspect for the same reason, which is that over the last decade, they have not demonstrated how they add value to the business and so are being shut out.  Interesting parallels and some food for thought here.\r\n\r\n### [What Matters Most During a Data Breach? How You React](https://securityintelligence.com/what-matters-most-during-a-data-breach-how-you-react/)\r\n\r\n*\"The Ponemon Institute\u2019s 2017 study on the cost of a data breach showed companies have a one in four chance of experiencing such a breach within a two-year period.\" *\r\n\r\nBy this math, the chance of a data breach in any given year is around 1/8 or 12.5%. The raw report makes clear that these are \"material breaches\" of 1,000 records or more. Slightly more interesting, human error and system glitch was responsible for 53% of breaches, and malicious hackers are only responsible for 47%.  While I know that is true for small breaches (sending an email to the wrong user or cc'ing someone by accident), I didn't realise it would be so high for material breaches as well.  I suspect that things like misconfigured FTP servers or S3 buckets are counted here.\r\n\r\n### [Hackers exploit Jenkins servers, make $3 million by mining Monero | CSO Online](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3256314/security/hackers-exploit-jenkins-servers-make-3-million-by-mining-monero.html)\r\n\r\n*\"The attackers are leveraging CVE-2017-1000353, a flaw disclosed in a Jenkins security advisory issued in April 2017. Besides making the attackers millionaires, the \"JenkinsMiner\" could impact servers by slowing their performance and issuing denial of service.\"*\r\n\r\nThis one terrifies me. The security around our CI estates tends to be quite poor, because it isn't part of the \"production estate\" for most development teams. But malware on that machine can arbitrarily change any code deployed to any part of your infrastructure. This is the weak point in any agile organisation with continuous delivery.  That the attackers in this case just wanted to mine Monero on the high powered CI server is lucky and fortuitous, it could be much much worse\r\n\r\n### [DIB: Detecting Agile BS](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/09/2002049591/-1/-1/0/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF)\r\n\r\n*Agile is a buzzword of software development, and so all DoD software development projects are, almost by default, now declared to be \"agile.\" The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to DoD program executives and acquisition professionals on how to detect software projects that are really using agile development versus those that are simply waterfall or spiral development in agile clothing (\u201cagile-scrum-fall\u201d).*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis guide is a great little take on how governance boards and senior executives can tell real agile projects from waterfall projects that have been merely rebranded into agile.\r\n\r\nThe questions at the end should form part of any assessment process you have for agile projects\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n# Long reads or entertaining stories\r\n\r\n*These amused me this year, or were just enjoyable long form journalism, a deep dive into a subject that gave me a far better understanding of a topic I didn\u2019t know before.*\r\n\r\n### [The man who cracked the lottery](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-iowa-lottery-fraud-mystery.html)\r\n\r\n*\"And that\u2019s when the idea first came. \u201cJust like a little seed that was planted,\" Tipton said in his proffer. \u201cAnd then during one slow period I just had a \u2014 had a thought that it\u2019s possible, and I tried it and I put it in.\u201d\u201d*\r\n\r\nInteresting account of a real insider job.

I think the deeper AI work in here will be more useful for analysts dealing with the question of why and attribution in the future.\r\n\r\n### [Why do we care so much about privacy? The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/18/why-do-we-care-so-much-about-privacy)\r\n\r\n*\"The law is constantly playing catch-up. In the digital age, almost all transactions are recorded somewhere, and almost any information worth keeping private involves a third party. Most of us store more in the cloud than in lockboxes. It does not make sense to constrain the technological capacities of law enforcement just because the technology allows it to work more efficiently, but those capacities can also lead to a society whose citizens have nowhere to hide.\"*\r\n\r\nA fascinating long read about the history of privacy laws (primarily in the US). The interesting equivalence made over and over is that we care far more when a computer scans us than we do when an individual does. The gift that technology gives us is scale and speed, but that\u2019s precisely the thing that creates unintended consequences further down the road.\r\n\r\n### *[Why Are There So Damn Many Ubers? | Village Voic*e](https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/06/15/why-are-there-so-many-damn-ubers/)\r\n\r\n*\"A terribly overused buzzword that internet companies like to use is \u201cfrictionless,\"but it\u2019s a decent term to describe what happened next. Stripped down to its essence, the process of using Uber was the way black car services had always worked: You used a phone to make a car come to you, and you paid by credit card. As Ackman told the Times, \u201cIt\u2019s not that different from using Google or a directory to find a car service.\u201d But the app made everything easier for both the driver and the passenger; GPS in particular meant the driver could home right in on you rather than having to work out where exactly you were via conversation with a dispatcher. Having your credit card on file meant you didn\u2019t have to think about payment on every trip. \u201c. *\r\n\r\nThis great description of disruption and frictionless design is a good reminder of how users can circumnavigate a set of regulations and rules if it\u2019s easy. In cyber security things like BYOD, Slack, Trello, G-Suite and more are frictionless \"shadow IT\" that can circumnavigate our security policies. This isn\u2019t to say our policies are great but that we need to heavily rethink them to work with these tools instead of looking to the past\r\n\r\n### [You used to build a wall to keep them out, but now hackers are destroying you from the inside | WIRED UK](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/darktrace-insider-threats-hackers-security)\r\n\r\n*Organisations are also vulnerable at many more points. The internet of things is rapidly expanding what security experts call\"the attack surface\". Intruders can now enter an organisation through a vending machine, a smart thermostat or a TV, not to mention one of the many connected devices that employees carry or wear every day. The gatekeepers, outwitted and overrun, have responded like authoritarian leaders attempting to clamp down on crime, introducing increasingly draconian security policies. But when employees subsequently find it harder to work, innovate and experiment, the business suffers.\"*\r\n\r\nAs it says. I'd argue that it's not even the Internet of Things, it's people trying to work around the VPN, people using their iphones as hotspots, and people forwarding emails via their personal accounts that bypasses all of the \"gatekeepers\". But everything else here, I agree with.\r\n\r\nFor me, this is probably the long read of the week.\r\n\r\n### [The SIM Hijackers - Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin)\r\n\r\n\"By hijacking Rachel\u2019s phone number, the hackers were able to seize not only Rachel\u2019s Instagram, but her Amazon, Ebay, Paypal, Netflix, and Hulu accounts too. None of the security measures Rachel took to secure some of those accounts, including two-factor authentication, mattered once the hackers took control of her phone number.\"\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of discussion around two-factor at the moment, because it's not a panacea, and we know that sim-swapping in the US and SS7 hijacking in europe and various other exploits work against it. But it massively increases the baseline of effort that an attacker has to go through compared to not having it. Don't let stories like this put you off of two-factor authentication, just remember that it's not perfect.\r\n\r\n### [The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\r\n\r\n*\"It\u2019s the story of a nation-state\u2019s weapon of war released in a medium where national borders have no meaning, and where collateral damage travels via a cruel and unexpected logic: Where an attack aimed at Ukraine strikes Maersk, and an attack on Maersk strikes everywhere at once.\"*\r\n\r\nThis is a fascinating read generally, but this sentence struck me. The interconnectedness of computers has been seen over and over again, from WannaCry to NotPetya to the early spread of the Morris Worm. It's increasingly difficult to reliably and ethically determine what a valid computer target should be for any form of cyber warfare, and as the control of the techniques is no where nearly as easily controlled as the one for the mechanistic capability to produce nuclear weapons, the increasing proliferation of these weapons to more and more non-nation-state groups seems likely and deeply worrying.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### [The Amazon machine \u2014 Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/12/12/the-amazon-machine)\r\n\r\n\"This means not so much that products on Amazon are commodities (this is obvious) but that product categories on Amazon are commodities. This model has two obvious consequences for Amazon. The first is that it can scale almost indefinitely - if you can launch x in y without a meeting or a new org structure, the speed of expansion into new categories is limited mostly by your ability to hire and to procure (and also by consumers\u2019 willingness to buy a new category online, of course).\"\r\n\r\nThis is a great read from Benedict that I think really sums up the Amazon model very well. I think a lot of people misconstrue the big technology giants, Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook as being essentially the same, but fundamentally they have very different business models, and it will be interesting to see which ones thrive and prosper more in changing economic climates.\r\n\r\n### [Cyber security \u2013 why you\u2019re doing it all wrong](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Cyber-security-why-youre-doing-it-all-wrong)\r\n\r\n*\"For too long, security teams have lived the lie that what they have delivered has been effective, but so often they approach it from a viewpoint divorced from the customers they affect. To be fair to most security teams, they are generally blissfully unaware of the inefficiencies of their controls \u2013 or ignorant.*\r\n\r\n*This is admittedly a very sweeping statement, but headline after headline about data breaches tends to argue the point. And let\u2019s not be shy here \u2013 these are major corporations with systemic failures when it comes to protecting their crown jewels. Something doesn\u2019t sit right. How can this be? Spending on IT security is at an all-time high. The volume of security offerings to cover every possible facet of security is unparalleled.\"*\r\n\r\nEverything about this essay is right. Security is often a complete disaster with failure to recognise what is the reality. We need to take a hard look at what we achieve and determine whether any of our security controls that we take all of our time maintaining is actually worth spending that time.\r\n\r\n### [How an inmate hacker turned a prison upside down - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/10/16447264/prison-hacker-recycled-computer-fraud-ohio-marion-transkiy)\r\n\r\n*\"Transkiy was being questioned about an extraordinary form of contraband.

They\u2019d somehow obtained a login to the prison\u2019s network, gaining access to the inner workings of the facility, including databases on inmates and the tools for creating passes needed to enter restricted areas. The computers also granted access to the outside world, which someone had used to apply for credit cards using the stolen identity of a prisoner. The scheme extended from the prison, to a community nonprofit, to multiple banks \u2014 all done under the noses of an oblivious prison staff.\"*\r\n\r\nThis is a lovely story showing how one can abuse a system and the ways you can slip through the cracks of a system if you know what you are doing.\r\n\r\n### [Inside the OPM Hack, The Cyberattack that Shocked the US Government | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/)\r\n\r\n*But the plan pays too little attention to a fundamental flaw in our approach to security: We\u2019re overly focused on prevention at the expense of mitigation. One reason these attackers can do so much damage is that the average time between a malware infection and discovery of the attack is more than 200 days, a gap that has barely narrowed in recent years.*\r\n\r\n*\"We can\u2019t operate with the mindset that everything has to be about keeping them out,\" says Rich Barger, ThreatConnect\u2019s chief intelligence officer. \u201cWe have to operate knowing that they\u2019re going to get inside sometimes. The question is, how do we limit their effectiveness and conduct secure business operations knowing they\u2019re watching?\u201d Accomplishing that means building networks that are designed to limit a hacker\u2019s ability to maneuver and creating better ways to detect anomalous behavior by allegedly authorized users.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI had missed this 2 years ago and this looks to be one of the most thorough writeups of a technical breach by an APT that I've seen.

Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere's so much to this story that I don't think I can do it justice.\r\n\r\nFor starters, Apple has issued a very clear denial, [On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, \"hardware manipulations\" or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server.](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/), and Amazon was equally straight talking with [At no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in SuperMicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems. Nor have we engaged in an investigation with the government.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/). There is no way that these companies would issue such straight talking denials if they were being strong-armed by the Government and told they couldn't talk about these investigations.\r\n\r\nAmazon and Apple are interesting targets. Why for example, are Microsoft and Google not included as targets? How about Facebook, Twitter or other leading tech companies?\r\n\r\nHowever, the article contains a lot of details, and a very strong set of claims from Bloomberg, this isn't a fly by night newsletter and an article dashed off, this was an in depth investigation that must have been checked and vetted thoroughly. However, Bloomberg, and indeed these writers themselves, [have gotten the technical facts on stories wrong in the past stories](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1048322164653535232) so aren't foolproof.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side, I'm suspicious that a hardware implant, as described, can possibly achieve what is being described. Hosting systems inside Amazon and Apple are vastly complicated, and the networks are not designed to allow the hardware direct access to the internet. Instead a complex layer of Software Defined Networks overlay the network, because the hardware is often just a base for virtual machines and networks get complicated at that point.\r\n\r\nSomething that could inject code into the Baseboard Management Controller is very very low level, and the complexity of the software stack above them, which varies from system to system would make this an amazing feat of engineering to carry out.\r\n\r\nBut as has [been pointed out elsewhere](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/04/supermicro_bloomberg/), this is the dream of intelligence agencies the world round, an undetectable hardware implant that can take over the machine.\r\n\r\nWhat's the truth of these claims and counterclaims? I'm not sure we'll find out anytime soon. Unless Bloomberg is willing or capable of naming their sources, or their sources come back to correct the reporters, I don't think we'll find out what was actually said. Equally, denials from the companies will always be disbelieved, because the *spooky* nature of intelligence investigations means that any statement, even the most straight spoken, will be treated with suspicion. I personally doubt the validity of the story, I think there has been confusion in the reporting from the sources and the questions asked.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, I suspect that for most of us, this story is covering threat actors at the highest levels, and far beyond our reasonable threat model. You shouldn't be reviewing your hardware or picking a cloud provider based on this story.\r\n\r\nYour real threat today is still just as it was yesterday, that your users will click a link in a phishing email and enter their credentials into the site.\r\n\r\n### [China's Five Steps for Recruiting Spies in the US | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/china-spy-recruitment-us/)\r\n\r\n*Sifting through more than a dozen of the major cases that have targeted Westerners, though, provides an illuminating window into how China recruits its spies. The recruitment follows a well-known five-step espionage road map: Spotting, assessing, developing, recruiting, and, finally, what professionals call \"handling.\"*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is an interesting read and insight into human intelligence operations, and how they can be used to aid and advise technical intelligence operations.\r\n\r\n### [The Machine Fired Me](https://idiallo.com/blog/when-a-machine-fired-me)\r\n\r\n*After lunch, two people appeared at my desk. One was a familiar long face that seemed to avoid making direct eye contact. It was Jose and his fellow security guard. He cordially informed me that he was to escort me out of the building.*\r\n\r\n*The director was furious. They had received a very threatening email to escort me out of the building and were just doing their job.*\r\n\r\n*\"Who the hell is sending those emails!?\"*\r\n\r\n*I was fired. There was nothing my manager could do about it. There was nothing the director could do about it. They stood powerless as I packed my stuff and left the building.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, I love this story, well written and humorous. But it also tells me that someone somewhere actually loves a Joiners/Movers/Leavers process. The Leavers process is often a very poor weak point in most systems, especially around contractors. Find the right person leaving because their manager was fired and you'll find someone whose leaving forms and process was not done correctly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### [How Anna Delvey Tricked New York\u2019s Party People](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html?utm_source=tw&utm_medium=s3&utm_campaign=sharebutton-b)\r\n\r\n*The following January, Anna hired a PR firm to put together a birthday party at one of her favorite restaurants, Sadelle\u2019s in Soho. \"It was a lot of very cool, very successful people,\" said Huang, who, while aware Anna owed him money for their Venice trip, remained mostly unconcerned about it, at least until the restaurant, having seen Polaroids of Huang and Anna at the party on Instagram, messaged him a few days later. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Do you have her contact info?\u2019\u2005\u201d he says now. \u201c\u2005\u2018Because she didn\u2019t pay her bill.\u2019 Then I realized, Oh my God, she is not legit.\u201d*\r\n\r\n*As Anna bounced around the globe, there was some speculation as to where her means to do this came from, though no one seemed to care that much so long as the bills got paid.*\r\n\r\n*\"I thought she had family money,\" said Jayma Cardoso, one of the owners of the Surf Lodge in Montauk. Delvey\u2019s father was a diplomat to Russia, one friend was sure. No, another insisted, he was an oil-industry titan. \u201cAs far as I knew, her family was the Delvey family that is big in antiques in Germany,\u201d said another acquaintance, a millionaire tech CEO. (It is unclear what family he was referring to.)*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful long read on a scammer living it up and mostly managing to pull it off. A reminder that everybody is capable of being duped, and that people generally want to believe whats in front of them rather than that they might be being duped\r\n\r\n### [The Equifax Data Breach [PDF]](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Equifax-Report.pdf)\r\n\r\n*Equifax continued its incident investigation by conducting vulnerability testing of the ACIS application.*\r\n\r\n*Equifax discovered flaws in the ACIS code rendering the system vulnerable to SQL injection and Insecure Direct Object Reference attacks. The SQL injection flaw allows an attacker to inject or retrieve database information. The Insecure Direct Object Reference flaw allows direct access to system data without requiring appropriate authentication or authorization. The ACIS application had been tested for vulnerabilities in April 2017 after Equifax knew about the Apache Struts flaw and no unremediated vulnerabilities were found. It is unclear why the April 2017 vulnerability testing and the July 30, 2017 vulnerability testing produced different results.*\r\n\r\n*[...]*\r\n\r\n*On a 7:00 am call with the initial Project Sierra group, Equifax\u2019s Vulnerability Assessment team discussed the findings of the ACIS application review conducted on July 30.230 The team had identified an unexpected JSP file inserted into the ACIS application through SQL injection.*\r\n\r\n*[...]*\r\n\r\n*Equifax discovered code within the JSP file provided the avenue for the exploit. Following this 7:00 am call, a second unexpected JSP file was identified within the ACIS application.*\r\n\r\n*[...]*\r\n\r\n*Later on July 31, the Vulnerability Assessment team conducted a manual review looking for additional instances of Apache Struts on other servers.A vulnerable version of Apache Struts was discovered on a second server within the ACIS application. Equifax did not load a SSL certificate on this server, so it did not have visibility into the traffic to and from this server. Equifax uploaded a SSL certificate for this domain on August 3.246*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is really important reading. This makes clear that there is no single root cause in this breach. As in all incidents, there are many many failures that contribute to each other and cause this to fail. You could say that there are flaws in the processes, divisions in the organisation and failures of accountability, but those are always the case in systems that haven't been breached. The failures here are numerous and sometimes shocking.\r\n\r\n# Cybersecurity advances and the threat landscape\r\n\r\n*How have things been changing over the year, and what are bad people actually doing?  These links cover the changes in security itself*\r\n\r\n### [The worst truism in information security - The Blagoblag](https://alexgaynor.net/2018/jul/20/worst-truism-in-infosec/)\r\n\r\n\"Attackers just need one vulnerability, defenders need to be perfect\r\n\r\nThis may be the single most repeated truism in information security. Just this week, a colleague invoked this, with the quip that those of us who've chosen defense must be pretty dumb, given the challenge of that task, and the possibility of an easier career in offense.\"\r\n\r\nThere is so much good in here, but I wanted to call out this attitude. If you think the job of being an ethical hacker/red team in your organisation is to win, to just break stuff, then you are part of the problem. The only reason you exist is to help the organisation, and just breaking stuff and walking away is not helping.\r\n\r\nIf your red team has this attitude, then you should get rid of them and get a new red team. A red teams job is about 10% breaking your stuff, and 90% sitting and working with the team to build a better defence.\r\n\r\nEqually, as this article says, this dichotomy of systems being secure or insecure is entirely a fallacy.  We know that we have unpatched systems, that there are possible vulnerabilities in our systems.  We exist to help make priority decisions over how to spend a limited amount of security capital.\r\n\r\nSecurity vendors and as a profession doesn't make enough of how to make reasonable choices on security, instead everyone is shouting that if you just fix passwords/install a threat detection tool/upgrade your firewalls/install an APT defence black box, then all of your security issues will go away.\r\n\r\n### [Why Isn't Secure DevOps Being Practiced?](https://securityintelligence.com/why-isnt-secure-devops-being-practiced/)\r\n\r\n*\"While adoption varies by industry, the report found only a 12 percent margin between the highest and lowest adopters by industry. High-tech industries lead with 56 percent adoption, while retail was ranked last at 44 percent integration of app security testing in CI/CD workflows. Most commonly, organizations rely on software analysis scanning solutions, dynamic analysis methodologies and third-party penetration testing when secure DevOps is practiced in the enterprise.\"*\r\n\r\nI agree with a lot of this report, especially that the big barriers to embedding security in the build pipeline is because tooling isn\u2019t easy to automate and the large number of false positives. But that last reason *\"developer indifference\"* could be turned around to say *\u201csecurity hasn\u2019t made itself relevant\u201d*.\r\n\r\nIn the same way DevOps is about aligning development and operations to care about business goals, I think devsecops is more than just build pipelines, it\u2019s about enabling developers to deliver business value, with security enabling developers to do that.\r\n\r\n### [Nation-state hackers attempted to use Equifax vulnerability against DoD, NSA official says](https://www.cyberscoop.com/dod-apache-struts-equifax-david-hogue-nsa/)\r\n\r\n*\"Within 24 hours I would say of whenever an exploit or vulnerability is released, it is weaponized and used against us,\" said Hogue. Hogue also said the use of \u201czero day\u201d vulnerabilities to breach systems appears to be increasingly rare, based on his own work.*\r\n\r\n*\"At NSA we have not responded to an intrusion response that\u2019s used a zero day vulnerability in over 24 months,\" Hogue said. \u201cThe majority of incidents we see are a result of hardware and software updates that are not applying.\u201d*\r\n\r\nThis is old, and I tweeted about it at CyberUK 2018 this year, but it's worth us working out what the definition of a 0-day is. Most vulnerability researchers mean the use of a vulnerability before the patch is released or the vulnerability is announced. But if your organisation can't patch quicker than say 7 days, then all of the vulnerabilities released between day 0 and day 7 might as well be a 0-day as far as you are concerned. That is to say, the longer your patching cycle, the more 0-days you'll effectively be vulnerable to.\r\n\r\n### [On the Hunt for FIN7: Pursuing an Enigmatic and Evasive Global Criminal Operation \u00ab On the Hunt for FIN7: Pursuing an Enigmatic and Evasive Global Criminal Operation | FireEye Inc](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/fin7-pursuing-an-enigmatic-and-evasive-global-criminal-operation.html)\r\n\r\n*We have identified job advertisements for Combi Security that have been posted on popular Russian, Ukrainian, and Uzbek job recruitment sites, as well as numerous individuals who most likely worked for the company.

Do you know who you work for?\r\n\r\nThere's an interesting grey line in the infosec community, and it makes me wonder about the CTF's, coding challenges and so forth, and whether these are being mined for new and novel techniques for advanced actors.\r\n\r\n### [GAO-19-128 WEAPON SYSTEMS CYBERSECURITY](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf)\r\n\r\n*A patch or software enhancement that causes problems in an email system is inconvenient, whereas one that affects an aircraft or missile system could be catastrophic.*\r\n\r\n*Officials from one program we met with said they are supposed to apply patches within 21 days of when they are released, but fully testing a patch can take months due to the complexity of the system. Even when patches have been tested, applying the patches may take additional time.*\r\n\r\n*Further, weapon systems are often dispersed or deployed throughout the world. Some deployed systems may only be patched or receive software enhancements when they return to specific locations.*\r\n\r\n*Although there are valid reasons for delaying or forgoing weapon systems patches, this means some weapon systems are operating, possibly for extended periods, with known vulnerabilities.*\r\n\r\n*[...]*\r\n\r\n*One test team emulated a denial of service attack by rebooting the system, ensuring the system could not carry out its mission for a short period of time.

Activity has gone from a virtually non-exist issue to one that almost universally shows up at the top of our members\u2019 threat lists. Combined data from several CTA members shows a 459 percent increase in illicit cryptocurrency mining malware detections since 2017. Recent quarterly trend reports from CTA members show that this rapid growth shows no signs of slowing down. If 2017 was defined by the threat of ransomware, 2018 has been dominated by illicit cryptocurrency mining.*\r\n\r\n*For many, this may not seem like an important issue. What difference does it make if someone is stealing my computing power to mine cryptocurrencies? However, illicit mining is the \"canary in the coal mine\" of cybersecurity threats. If illicit cryptocurrency mining is taking place on your network, then you most likely have worse problems and we should consider the future of illicit mining as a strategic threat. More sophisticated actors could use \u2013 or may already by using \u2013 that same access to lay the groundwork for you to have a really bad day.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is a huge increase in targeted attacks, and as the blogpost says, if someone has the ability to put a coin mining script onto your service, whether backend or potentially worse, frontend; then they have the ability to do far worse if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to me that there's such a rise in this, it indicates that economically speaking, the blackhat hacker community sees more value in abusing stolen credentials and site takeovers for CPU mining than they do for the value of stealing the data on those systems. The report says that it's due to the rise in value in the coin markets, but I wonder if there is a collapse in the value of personal data because of how much is out there, the actions of police forces to crackdown on dark markets where it can be sold?\r\n\r\nIf the bitcoin markets collapsed, I wonder if this activity would go away, and what would replace it?\r\n\r\nEqually, I'd expect the next step to move from hacked websites and credentials into coinhive scripts being injected into software chain dependencies. Some analysis on your dependencies to determine if they are running any coin mining might be interesting to consider in a build pipeline at the moment\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n# News Stories of the year\r\n\r\n*Some of the biggest or most interesting stories of the year, and my analysis of them when they happened*\r\n\r\n### [JavaScript PCI nightmare: Ticketmaster, Inbenta and the canary in the coal mine](https://doublepulsar.com/javascript-pci-nightmare-ticketmaster-inbenta-and-the-canary-in-the-coal-mine-5c7410e8565b)\r\n\r\n*\"I\u2019ll give you a spoiler: the risk is very real\u200a\u2014\u200athis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened, somebody who works for PCI post breach assessment told me that over 75% of all web store breaches they assessed at large enterprises happened due to this reason, a massive increase.\" *\r\n\r\nThis is a mess of 'PCI as a standard' not keeping up with modern web practices, and as Kevin points out, the canary in the coalmine for supply chain infections in Javascript.

Jigsaw identification is a common threat for people who are trying to keep their identity secret. Early court injunctions simply told newspapers they couldn't identify celebrities involved in salacious court cases, but it meant that one might identify the team, whereas another newspaper would name the age. Courts fixed this by telling newspapers exactly what they could or could not identify about the court identities.  No commercial organisation can reasonably protect the identity of these sensitive individuals, as they don't know the sensitivity, and as such the responsibility tends to lie with the individual and any guidance from their organisation.

When the compromise was suspected, the FBI and NSA both ran*\"penetration tests\"*to determine the security of the interim system. They found that cyber experts with access to the interim system could also access the broader covert communications system the agency was using to interact with its vetted sources, according to the former officials.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting read, and a reminder that some of the patterns we use in cybersecurity are important and do result in life or death for real people in real places sometimes. The description further down of the counterintelligence service forming a specific task force to attempt to break the system is a healthy reminder that the sort of adversary that you can face at these higher levels is determined and capable\r\n\r\n### [The CIA's communications suffered a catastrophic compromise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html)\r\n\r\n*The losses could have stopped there. But U.S. officials believe Iranian intelligence was then able to compromise the covert communications system. At the CIA, there was \"shock and awe\" about the simplicity of the technique the Iranians used to successfully compromise the system, said one former official.*\r\n\r\n*In fact, the Iranians used Google to identify the website the CIA was using to communicate with agents. Because Google is continuously scraping the internet for information about all the world\u2019s websites, it can function as a tremendous investigative tool \u2014 even for counter-espionage purposes. And Google\u2019s search functions allow users to employ advanced operators \u2014 like \"AND,\" \u201cOR,\u201d and other, much more sophisticated ones \u2014 that weed out and isolate websites and online data with extreme specificity.*\r\n\r\n*According to the former intelligence official, once the Iranian double agent showed Iranian intelligence the website used to communicate with his or her CIA handlers, they began to scour the internet for websites with similar digital signifiers or components \u2014 eventually hitting on the right string of advanced search terms to locate other secret CIA websites. From there, Iranian intelligence tracked who was visiting these sites, and from where, and began to unravel the wider CIA network*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think I first covered this back in CyberWeekly #13, with a report from ForeignPolicy on the breach of the CIA covert informant network.

She noticed the vulnerability, and then conciously exploited it, gaining access to someone else's information. And she took a screenshot and tweeted it. We train journalists on court proceedings and contempt of court, but not on the computer misuse act?\r\n\r\nSecondly, there's an ethical question here about whether it's ethical to tweet the mechanism of a vulnerability. As a journalist, she had her story, she had her screenshots, she could have contacted CCHQ and told them about the vulnerability, and then published once the app was taken down or fixed.\r\n\r\nBy choosing to explain exactly how to find the vulnerability, she chose to endanger the personal data of people in that application, and that's exactly what the \"crowd\" then did.\r\n\r\nThe defense here is that the vulnerability was so simple that actually you didn't need to tell anyone how to do it, it was obvious and clear, and pointing out the obvious and clear isn't any form of recklessness nor an ethical breach, in fact it would be an ethical breach not to point it out.\r\n\r\nAll in all this was just an awful showing all round\r\n\r\n# Digital and other non-cybersecurity stories\r\n\r\n### [Delivering for citizens: How to triple the success rate of government transformations | McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/delivering-for-citizens-how-to-triple-the-success-rate-of-government-transformations)\r\n\r\n*\"Another challenge is a lack of leadership longevity. For example, a review of ministers of health across 23 countries from 1990 to 2009 found that half of them served for less than two years in office.\"*\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a bunch interesting in this report, but this stood out. If political appointees, regardless of country, don\u2019t stay longer than 2 years, which is far shorter than most operational Cybersecurity risks take to materialise, how will we ever get people to prioritise good operational security?\r\n\r\n### [Monzo \u2013 Engineering Principles at Monzo](https://monzo.com/blog/2018/06/29/engineering-principles/)\r\n\r\n*\"We now have a team of over 70 engineers working on this, with more joining every week. As we continue to grow, it\u2019s crucial that we create a shared understanding of what \u201cgood\"* looks like so that existing engineers know how to make decisions and prioritise work and new engineers know what we expect and how we work.\u201d\r\n\r\nI think this article is brilliant for its advice, but I wanted to highlight it for this comment. From my experiences at GDS and the Guardian as well as helping other government departments build out digital teams, one thing is clear. Scaling people is really hard. The Dunbar number means that all of those assumptions and things that *\"everyone knows\"* probably aren\u2019t obvious to everyone and when you scale past around 25 people you need to put real effort into documenting and communicating those cultural assumptions and practices if you want them to succeed.\r\n\r\n### [Executives and Transparency](https://theitriskmanager.wordpress.com/2018/07/01/executives-and-transparency/)\r\n\r\n*\"Jira is a tool developed to help teams manage their development. It is not a tool to manage across teams or at an enterprise level. In order to create transparency for executives, you need an expert who can extract the data you need to create the views they need. One of the graduates working with us created an app to extract data from Jira into an SQL based database. Once the data was in the SQL database it took a couple of days to create an excel report that gave an executive view of lead time using weighted lead time.\"*\r\n\r\nThere is quite a lot of interesting bits and pieces in here about transformation and transparency, but this caught my eye. How often do we see agile teams grumble that the executives or leaders could come down and see the *\"wall\".*  What our teams often fail to realise is that the wall of cards, or tool like Jira, is optimised to be used by the day to day users of the thing. There is a value in senior leaders seeing that, to ensure that they aren\u2019t being hoodwinked, and to understand where the *\u201croll up\u201d* numbers come from, but actually, burn down charts, story estimation, velocity or other summation metrics are far more useful for these leaders, and creating those metrics, those dashboards takes time, energy and effort. As an agile team, you need to put in that energy or effort. Simply grumbling that the leadership don\u2019t come to your show and tell, or don\u2019t come and walk the wall wont lead to success\r\n\r\n### [The Good Censor - Google Leak](http://j.mp/2pNDzBp)\r\n\r\n*Relentless, 24/7 online conversations encourage people to dive in with their opinion* before it's too late, even if they're misinformed. And because we think with out emotional brain before rational one, instant response *amplify emotion-led discourse* not thoughtful debate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis was linked to me in terms of *OMG, a good censor, how terrible*, but I think it's actually a very good breakdown of the debate about free-speech online and the position of a platform.\r\n\r\nBut this entire section about users bad behaviour stood out to me. We often accuse users of our IT products of bad security behaviours. But this section really highlights the fact that we need to better understand people's psychology and the reasons behind their actions. Because while people aren't always logical, they are always taking their actions for a deliberate reason.\r\n\r\n### [Recovery from Command-and-Control: A Twelve-Step Program | Humanistic Systems](https://humanisticsystems.com/2014/07/12/recovery-from-command-and-control-a-twelve-step-program/)\r\n\r\n*Command-and-control gives management the illusion that they are in control of the work and the workers, and that this control leads to effectiveness. Distance between decision making about the work and the work itself makes decision makers think that when things go right, it is because they are being done as specified: by the book. When things go wrong, it is because people did not do their job: they screwed up.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is an old article, but relevant I think. Command and control organisations often struggle with scale. Those at the top cannot possibly know what is going on at the bottom, but are expected to make decisions and give commands to those people.\r\n\r\nThis asymmetry of information is essentially what all project management is about, trying to get information from the bottom up to the top in the most efficient and effective way, and I don't think we have a good solution yet.\r\n\r\n### [2018 State of Digital Transformation | Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/2018-state-digital-transformation)\r\n\r\n*We\u2019ve attempted to codify a lot of what we\u2019ve been hearing from various units into a framework around five[sic] high-level themes:*\r\n\r\n* *Political environment*\r\n\r\n* *Institutional capacity*\r\n\r\n* *Delivery capability*\r\n\r\n* *Skills and hiring*\r\n\r\n* *User-centered design*\r\n\r\n* *Cross-government platforms.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is a great report and digital teams should read it all.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that security doesn\u2019t come up at any point in this entire report. The digitisation of government goes on regardless of the opinions of security people and I think that\u2019s probably right. It shows how far most security teams are from engaging with digital work and how digital people still view security as primarily a blocker to what they want to achieve.\r\n\r\nIf I were to define security in that maturity matrix, it would be interesting to think about what high capability security teams actually look like, because I think they wouldn\u2019t look like most of our security teams today.\r\n\r\n### [The Technology That Changed Air Travel](https://tryretool.com/blog/air-travel-software/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)\r\n\r\n*Thankfully, there might be a solution \u2014 XML.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s astonishing that in this day and age this is actually still true, many people still use this interface paradigm. The number of critical systems that are still processed and managed by technology from decades ago is astonishing and frankly quite scary when you consider how much the security assumptions have changed in that time. Computers are now interconnected in a myriad of ways that just weren't possible back when this was all created.\r\n\r\nThankfully, XML is coming to our rescue! I\u2019ve always said that XML is like violence. If it\u2019s not solving the problem, you clearly aren\u2019t using enough of it!\r\n\r\nI once worked with a Bloomberg XML API, it included an xml document with 40 elements each of which had a CDATA block of exactly 80 characters.

We've seen such a variety of things in 2018, from massive botnets, malware campaigns and phishing campaigns, to companies selling us security on the blockchain and AI driven firewalls.\r\n\r\nThis week, I think the thing that struck me the most was when I was out at drinks and talking to people about their predictions for 2019.  One of the things that might totally change the security landscape next year is the increase in diplomatic pressure on the country level threat actors at the highest level.  It sends a serious message to smaller countries, that they will be detected and called out on the world stage, and signals a new seriousness about telling the world what we know about the big countries as well.  I'm interested to see what the response is in the new year, whether it results in a quieter safer year for us all.  At this time of year, one can only hope.\r\n\r\nAnyway, more about that next week as I prepare for a backward look at some of the biggest stories, including some of my favourites from the year, and a forward look to peoples predictions for 2019.",

The SQL injection flaw allows an attacker to inject or retrieve database information.  The Insecure Direct Object Reference flaw allows direct access to system data without requiring appropriate authentication or authorization.  The ACIS application had been tested for vulnerabilities in April 2017 after Equifax knew about the Apache Struts flaw and no unremediated vulnerabilities were found.  It is unclear why the April 2017 vulnerability testing and the July 30, 2017 vulnerability testing produced different results.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nOn a 7:00 am call with the initial Project Sierra group, Equifax\u2019s Vulnerability Assessment team discussed the findings of the ACIS application review conducted on July 30.230 The team had identified an unexpected JSP file inserted into the ACIS application through SQL injection.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nEquifax discovered code within the JSP file provided the avenue for the exploit. Following this 7:00 am call, a second unexpected JSP file was identified within the ACIS application.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nLater on July 31, the Vulnerability Assessment team conducted a manual review looking for additional instances of Apache Struts on other servers.A vulnerable version of Apache Struts was discovered on a second server within the ACIS application. Equifax did not load a SSL certificate on this server, so it did not have visibility into the traffic to and from this server. Equifax uploaded a SSL certificate for this domain on August 3.246",

MindGeek owns several production companies of its own, which can harvest data analysis from MindGeek\u2019s porn sites, which also means that customized porn videos can be created efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis production side has proved profitable for MindGeek. \u201cWe still believe very strongly in the paid subscription model.

Organisations around the world tend to not to have good processes and they aren't always followed.\r\n\r\nEquifax had thing after thing go wrong in their handling of their breach, and the end finding? Processes weren't implemented properly.\r\n\r\nHow can we move beyond this? Maybe we can't, maybe we are stuck in a world where we will never get this right.  If the CIA can spend billions building covert communications systems that don't work when the users don't use them correctly, then how can we expect to do any better with less money and less on the line?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Equifax claimed to be collecting and managing more than 1200 times the amount of data in the Library of Congress every single day, but PornHub processed 4403 Petabytes of data in the last year, more than the entire internet in 2002.  We collectively allow organisations to amass, store and process very large amounts of data, but we don't seem to have models or processes for managing it effectively.\r\n\r\nMaybe we need to look at different models.  I've spent a fair bit of time looking at safety and reliability systems, where people assume that people, processes and systems are fallible and where failure is assumed.  Aviation safety got steadily worse from the 40s through to the 70s, but in the 70s a new model of blame free post mortem analysis models were bought in and airlines have got safer and safer ever since.  I think as an industry, security has a lot to learn from industries where safety is critical, and sadly, we just seem to keep producing reports like the Equifax one, that essentially shrugs and says \"People didn't follow the process\", as if the process is good, but the people are bad.  If your process isn't regularly followed, it's a bad process and you should change it, instead of hoping that people will change.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other news, this is the 30th newsletter in a row, and I'm pleased to say that there are 250 of you now subscribed to this newsletter.

In reality you should turn it on for as many people as possible.  If some of your userbase cannot use MFA, for example if they don't have work mobile phones, then exclude them and just get it turned on for everyone else first, and then come back to solve that problem after.

But for building a new system, often times the risk management process insists on a perfect implementation of security features and total risk reduction.\r\n\r\nWe need to remember that risk is acceptable.  Organisations succeed and fail based on their ability to desire to take risks to outperform their competitors.  Government doesn't need to perform in a market, but Government organistations operate in a highly complex and ambiguous environemnt, with the average term of a minister being around 18 months, the desires of the organisation changes on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nRisk management should be about taking advised risks, and know what your outstanding risk debt is.  It's about knowing and recording your risks and going ahead anyway.  It's about having a plan to improve that once you know more, once you have a thing that works and real customers and it's worth the effort to fix properly.\r\n\r\nEven ISO27001 ISMS systems talk about nonconformant systems and continual improvement, but rarely have I actually seen a mitigation plan put in place that will continuously improve the risk posture of something.  Instead we rely on people making sensible decisions inside programs to do this for us.\r\n\r\nThat said, we also focus often on the wrong things.  We spend a lot of time concentrating on firewalls and preventing users from having admin privileges, and stopping users from accessing modern tools like slack (Or maybe that's just in Government), but we still can't patch desktop machines within a few hours, know the state our servers should be in, or let our users use memorable complex passphrases instead of P@ssword1.\r\n\r\nWe can't build a perfect system in advance of every possible risk or concern, and we shouldn't be trying, instead we need to do the simple things that we know work, and then build on top of those foundations.",

This explanation does a good job of explaining the process, but sadly doesn't give us any insight into what the actual considerations are.

Marriott quickly engaged leading security experts to help determine what occurred. Marriott learned during the investigation that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014. Marriott recently discovered that an unauthorized party had copied and encrypted information, and took steps towards removing it. On November 19, 2018, Marriott was able to decrypt the information and determined that the contents were from the Starwood guest reservation database.\r\n\r\nMarriott has not finished identifying duplicate information in the database, but believes it contains information on up to approximately 500 million guests who made a reservation at a Starwood property. For approximately 327 million of these guests, the information includes some combination of name, mailing address, phone number, email address, passport number, Starwood Preferred Guest (\u201cSPG\u201d) account information, date of birth, gender, arrival and departure information, reservation date, and communication preferences. For some, the information also includes payment card numbers and payment card expiration dates, but the payment card numbers were encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard encryption (AES-128). There are two components needed to decrypt the payment card numbers, and at this point, Marriott has not been able to rule out the possibility that both were taken. For the remaining guests, the information was limited to name and sometimes other data such as mailing address, email address, or other information. Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation. We have already begun notifying regulatory authorities.",

I recently read a threat intelligence brief that included the action of reviewing an organisations github commit history and looking up each address in the HaveIBeenPwned database to determine how many accounts had been included in breaches.\r\n\r\nBut this signal is extraordinarily weak when used this way, because HaveIBeenPwned cannot tell you whether that account took any remediating action.  If you look up my email address, you'll see that I was breached in the Adobe breach, along with a bunch of the spam databases and other large breaches.  In the adobe case in particular, I was notified and immedietely changed my password.  I also happened to reuse that password on other sites, and so I changed it on those sites as well.\r\n\r\nBut HaveIBeenPwned cannot know that I took those actions.  And if you use it to assess whether email addresses associated with a github project have ever been breached, you don't actually understand the impact that it is having.\r\n\r\nThe front website increasingly could just be replaced with the word \"Yes\" and it would be just as effective a threat signal, and indeed, when we consider public email accounts, we should adopt a \"Assume Breached\" concept.  What that looks like, I'm not sure, but if you assumed that all of your users email addresses and passwords were known to attackers, how would that change your security posture?  I suspect you'd want to roll out MFA on anything external pretty quick, which is why I still think that's the number one priority for organisations in my mind.\r\n\r\nNote that HaveIBeenPwned has an outstanding notification process, letting users and organisations know that an account was in a recent breach, and that is a high value signal, so I'm not dismissing the value generally, just in this threat intelligence use case",

            "intro": "This week had a bunch of interesting themes for me, but two in particular stand out.\r\n\r\nTom Loosemore and Dafydd Vaughan brilliantly explained the journey that digital government has been on and how far we've come.  It's very easy to dwell on the size of the challenge ahead, but let us also acknowledge just how much better it is than it was, and how much better prepared we are for the next steps.\r\n\r\nThe next steps are clear for Government, in terms of focusing on understanding how to operate services, not just build them, and how we go about funding that.  I think there are radical changes in funding models, but also in Governance, operational modelling and staffing that needs to happen as well when we think about operations rather than just building stuff.  If the strategy in 2013 was to deliver, the strategy in 2018 is not just to deliver, but to ensure that we aren't delivering new legacy.  To ensure that we are able to continue to improve, maintain and operate the things we build.\r\n\r\nThis conversation wouldn't have been possible in 2013, because there frankly just wasn't enough technical talent in Government to have the conversation with.  Lots of well meaning, hard working individuals, but not enough to form a profession and have a technical conversation that goes beyond simple management, policy and traditional operations.  The rise of the ability to have technical conversations across government, and the disagreements in models that come with that is a welcome challenge in my mind.\r\n\r\nThat leads me onto the other thing that really caught my eye this week.  GCHQ has published two separate policy pieces, both of which are strongly technical in their arguments.  The declassification and publication of the Equities system, and changing the discussion on lawful interception are both pieces of work that had they happened 5 or 10 years ago, would probably have been couched in non technical terms and discussed in a political arena.  They both have political ramifications and that conversation should happen, but the ability to also have them released in a technical arena means that engagement can be done by technical people in a way that it couldn't have before.\r\n\r\nThe increase in this public discourse, and across infosec general does mean more disagreement, more debate and more differing views, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.  Diversity of thought is vitally important for a healthy community (except where people disagree with me of course).  The next steps are for us to work out how to have these discussions without them descending into name calling, missed perspectives and people being offended.  That probably means we need to use twitter less to have these conversations (such as the City of York news this week), and more thoughtful debate in a long form, or face to face.",

We assume that people will follow procedures, that they like rules, and that they don't take decisions that would cause them personal harm, or secondarily that would cause them long term harm.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, we are all just humans who are trying to manage increasingly complex worlds around us.  We make mistakes, and we often take suboptimal decisions for a variety of reasons.  When we assume that organisations who reach a higher level of maturity will move away from procedures and policies towards enlightened self determinism (a philosophy I subscribe to), we need to be careful that we understand that these systems are much more vulnerable to bad actors, to poor decisions and to selfish short termist actions.  Some poeple would argue that procedures and policies protect us from those people, but they tend to be hyperbolic in their achievements (just see a redteam in action to see how effective those policies actually are), and they restrict the best and brightest from achieving using the latest tools.\r\n\r\nFrom the managers who mentally keep track of procedures and policies but never communicate them, to people making suboptimal decisions because they are drunk or on reddit, we see countless bits of evidence of how these systems don't really achieve what they set out to, but yet our idealism in the view of a \"Secure Development Life Cycle\" or change management persists in believing that we can bring order to the chaos that is humanity.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, apologies for the delay last week.  After much too-ing and fro-ing with TinyLetter, it turns out that linking to a domain related to gambling triggered all of the anti-spam measures at their end, and it took a long time for someone to work out what had happened or why.

It's about knowing how people behave, what they want and guiding them to do it in the most secure, safe and efficient manner.\r\n\r\nHowever, the devil is in the details, because the real world is far more complex than the nice models that we construct for ourselves, and people never actually behave like rational agents in reality.  People will refuse to use digital services that might make things easier, cheaper and better for themselves our of sheer bloodymindedness or spite, and people will share their passwords even if they know they shouldn't.\r\n\r\nOur biggest challenge as an industry is not just building good models of how to do this stuff right, but also coping with the complexity that we face when we try to implement those models, and understanding all of the edge cases that cannot possibly happen",

From the Ticketmaster hack to British Airways to SiteCounter, we are seeing increasingly that digital systems are using JavaScript from a variety of sources and nobody has a good grip on how to secure that supply chain, or in many cases, even visualise and understand the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWhat we haven\u2019t seen as much of yet is malicious software being injected into the supply chain on the server side, with software forming dependency chains of thousands of packages and very few integrity checks in the system, this is a problem that is wide open today.  I suspect the reason we have fewer attacks here is because the complexity of actually weaponising it into money is far higher than doing the same with third party JavaScript changes.  Criminal elements tend to pick the cheapest and simplest option that they can actually cash out on.\r\n\r\nThis problem is gigantic, and affects software that is open source as well as closed source, and I think we\u2019re only just beginning to understand the complexity of the situation.  There are no easy simple solutions, and few hard complex solutions that can be seen, so we are just going to have to live with the risk, and engage as many countermeasures as we can in the meantime.",

It's hard for leaders to actually know what is going on, and whether their direction or strategies are having any effect.\r\n\r\nI'm a big believer that the direction needs to be set from above, but the how we get there has to come from the teams actually doing the delivery.  A strategy that focuses on doing the basics first and foremost, and putting in place effective reporting and analysis is critical.

Don\u2019t use words such as your child\u2019s name or favourite sports team which are easy for people to guess by looking at your social media accounts or simple substitutions like \u2018Pa55word!\u2019.\r\n\r\n* When available you should use two-factor authentication (2FA) on your email account.

I think that security does depend on the context, and risk management is supposed to help you understand your context and take appropriate risks.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, I'm not sure it's actually working.  A friend (and subscriber) recently commented to me that they like the concept of risk assessment in theory, but fail to find any evidence of where it has added any value in the real world that we move in.\r\n\r\nThis is a sad indictment of the current state of risk assessment, especially in Government.  There are lots of nice in theory ideas about risk assessments, but too frequently, the technical implementation is beyond the technical capabilities of the security person doing risk assessment, and the processes are not setup to deliver good actionable results.\r\n\r\nThe DIB paper on detecting Agile BS in the defence sector is a great summation of some of the critical questions you need to ask of a project to determine whether it is actually doing agile well.  Things like \"Are teams empowered to change the requirements based on user feedback?\" and \"Is the full ecosystem of your project agile? (Agile programming teams followed by linear, bureaucratic deployment is a failure.)\".  I wonder if we need something similar for detecting security BS both in risk management programs, and in security operations and engineering as well.",

            "intro": "I've been thinking a lot about serverless recently.  I know that I'm years behind the cutting edge here, but I'm bullish that serverless is going to take off soon.  I'm hearing more and more that greenfield development should be starting with serverless architectures.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure I can actually define what serverless means though.  Many conversations over the last few weeks with colleagues has pursuaded me that my opinion of \"You must use Function-as-a-Service at the core\" is probably a good minimum bar for serverless systems, but that the ecosystem includes databases, queues, storage systems that are part of the serverless ecosystem.  Can we describe Amazon RDS as a \"serverless database\"?  I don't think so, but I think Google BigTable or Amazon Dynamo probably are.\r\n\r\nAs developer communities start to work out how to define serverless, and to work out what good practices actually look like in this world, I see a security community that has only just started to accept that the cloud is not just \"other peoples computers\". That it requires a new approach to security, and that the risks have changed significantly to different places in the system.  Serverless architectures are going to create a new world of problems for security specialists as the patterns that worked before really struggle to \"cross the rubicon\", and if we don't provide good security practice, we'll be left behind.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm shocked and surprised to discover that we passed 200 subscribers this week.  Hello to everyone new, I hope you find this newsletter interesting and useful.

Probably not.

In fact, complexity theory tells us that it's probably impossible to model for a real _\"complex system\"_.\r\n\r\nBut to me, the interesting thing here is none of that.  It's how GDPR is going to change reporting of bugs like this.\r\n\r\nFacebook was required to notify the ICO in Ireland (the primary GDPR enforcer for Facebook in Europe), within 72 hours of discovering the breach, thanks to GDPR.  They therefore published the information about the breach at the same time, which seems like a good idea on the face of it.\r\n\r\nBut with a breach this size, and this complex, it's very very hard to know which accounts were affected and whether there was any deliberate malicious abuse of the feature.  \r\n\r\nWe know there was some, because Facebook's account says that they noticed this because of unusual traffic patterns to the view as feature.  But that 50 million accounts?  It's easy for reporters to jump on that and accuse nations, or malicious actors of massive campaigns to attack peoples accounts, but we don't actually know if this was weaponised or used.  Facebook simply hasn't had time to do this analysis.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm all for timely release of breach information, there have been multiple breaches in recent memory where organisations took months or even years to reveal that there was a breach.  But I think it might require a change in journalistic behaviour, and an acknowledgement that far more often the answer to the questions we all want to know about the breach will be \"We don't know yet\", and that this is ok.\r\n\r\nJournalism doesn't have a great memory, the old adages about the news cycle lasting 24 hours is pretty accurate, and that means that we are unlikely to see the increased and better information coming out weeks or months later when Facebook or whoever is breached next, tells us an update.",

A phone number I give to Facebook for security purposes should never make it into the advertising bucket.  I can totally see how this might have happened, again complex systems are hard!  But GDPR makes this clearer, each piece of data that is gathered should be gathered under a specific form of consent, and your database is going to need to start to model that soon, because over time, you'll change your consent form, you'll change where you get data from etc.\r\n\r\nThis is going to hit companies again and again, because people haven't been doing this in the past.  Repeat after me, personal data is like toxic waste, keep it safe and secure and away from as much of your system as possible.\r\n\r\nSecondly, what on earth is facebook doing, offering advertisers a way to upload \"phone numbers they wish to target ads at\" and then serving ads that way.  I can't think of any good reason to enable this, and it is only going to worry users.  Any company that has a contact list of people who purchased from them before should be contacting them direct, and passing that list to Facebook is probably not acceptable under GDPR either.\r\n\r\nI really can't think of a reason that Facebook should be offering that service to advertisers, when they can offer significantly better targeting options to advertises that should be worth more.

                    "note": "There's so much to this story that I don't think I can do it justice.\r\n\r\nFor starters, Apple has issued a very clear denial, [On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, \u201chardware manipulations\u201d or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server.](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/), and Amazon was equally straight talking with [ At no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in SuperMicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems. Nor have we engaged in an investigation with the government.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/).  There is no way that these companies would issue such straight talking denials if they were being strong-armed by the Government and told they couldn't talk about these investigations.  \r\n\r\nAmazon and Apple are interesting targets. Why for example, are Microsoft and Google not included as targets? How about Facebook, Twitter or other leading tech companies?\r\n\r\nHowever, the article contains a lot of details, and a very strong set of claims from Bloomberg, this isn't a fly by night newsletter and an article dashed off, this was an in depth investigation that must have been checked and vetted thoroughly.  However, Bloomberg, and indeed these writers themselves, [have gotten the technical facts on stories wrong in the past stories](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1048322164653535232) so aren't foolproof.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side, I'm suspicious that a hardware implant, as described, can possibly achieve what is being described.  Hosting systems inside Amazon and Apple are vastly complicated, and the networks are not designed to allow the hardware direct access to the internet.  Instead a complex layer of Software Defined Networks overlay the network, because the hardware is often just a base for virtual machines and networks get complicated at that point.  \r\n\r\nSomething that could inject code into the Baseboard Management Controller is very very low level, and the complexity of the software stack above them, which varies from system to system would make this an amazing feat of engineering to carry out.\r\n\r\nBut as has [been pointed out elsewhere](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/04/supermicro_bloomberg/), this is the dream of intelligence agencies the world round, an undetectable hardware implant that can take over the machine.\r\n\r\nWhat's the truth of these claims and counterclaims?  I'm not sure we'll find out anytime soon.  Unless Bloomberg is willing or capable of naming their sources, or their sources come back to correct the reporters, I don't think we'll find out what was actually said.  Equally, denials from the companies will always be disbelieved, because the _spooky_ nature of intelligence investigations means that any statement, even the most straight spoken, will be treated with suspicion.  I personally doubt the validity of the story, I think there has been confusion in the reporting from the sources and the questions asked.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, I suspect that for most of us, this story is covering threat actors at the highest levels, and far beyond our reasonable threat model.  You shouldn't be reviewing your hardware or picking a cloud provider based on this story.\r\n\r\nYour real threat today is still just as it was yesterday, that your users will click a link in a phishing email and enter their credentials into the site.",

            "intro": "Phew.\r\n\r\nI didn't think reading and writing this weeks newsletter would ever end.  There's been so many interesting stories, and news that it took me a lot this week to read all of the summaries and try to find just the best links to share with you.  There have been several that have gone to the wayside in all of this, but I wanted to draw out two major points from all of the who-ha.\r\n\r\nTechnical reporting has come along in leaps and bounds, with reporters covering highly technical beats with style.  But most reporters just don't have the technical knowledge to actually understand the technology behind the things they are reporting on.  There are very few journalists who actually know what a cross-site-scripting attack actually looks like, or knows how javascript is packaged and executed.\r\n\r\nIn the SuperMicro story, we have some very good journalists, but clearly the exact technical details of this story is beyond them.  Is this chip actually embedded in the BMC? Does it have it's own operating system, ram, network etc? How would it be fitted to the board?  These are the questions that technical people are left asking, and these are the things that can confuse journalists reporting on such stories.\r\n\r\nIn the facebook phone number story, we see that that reporting is again unclear about how facebook actually operates and runs its organisation. Journalists imagine a machine army of people who write code, where that code is left alone and not touched later. But the likely thing is that the code that stores personal data and makes it available for advertising targeting is touched by thousands of people. We know from working in organisations that legacy code is often mysterious, that tests document the what of the code, but rarely actually document the why or the how.\r\n\r\nThere is increasing pressure on journalists to cover stories about technology, security, privacy, national security and business at a faster and faster pace, and we put a misplaced trust that journalistic organisations are capable of doing so consistently and factually all of the time.  But how can they possibly do so, especially given the skills shortages in these areas as it is?\r\n\r\nThe facebook and google stories lead me onto my second point, that technical organisations still don't understand why they need to segment and manage their user data carefully. Knowing how someone shared data with you, and what context they were in is important to not surprising them. And what might seem obvious at the time, will not make sense to the person reviewing your code in five years time, whether that's you or someone who replaced you.\r\n\r\nOnly by clearly managing personal data into small silos, where data is stored according to how it was collected and agreed to be processed can we build customer centered privacy by design into the systems that we build. Because, sad to say, we are building tomorrows legacy code today, and many of us won't be in the same organisations to tell people what we were thinking.",

Instead I think a lot of cybersecurity is more the emperors new clothes, in that we've convinced ourselves that because we have a shiny expensive new tool, we are fully protected.\r\n\r\nWe are getting better in small areas, and it's looking at these that gives me hope.  The ATT&CK framework from MITRE is something I was aware of before but took a proper look at this week, and the idea that we can start developing a shared language around threat models and frameworks is quite exciting.\r\n\r\nWe've also seen the declassification and publication of a secure operating system from France that looks interesting.  Until now there have been very few good products in this area, and it's nice that there are now multiple open source operating systems to choose from.",

While the theory of the government getting access to large amounts of data to help make decisions about policies might be good, the reality is that data collection is often poor, is often incentivised to be modified by exactly the same people who would fail to report on it via official mechanisms.\r\nThis article also highlights the second issue with large scale data collection and policy, in that organisations will over ambitiously attempt to implement their version of policies, regardless of the original intent.  The example in the article was one of a college not admitting a student because their parent was on a government blacklist, which wasn't the intent of the policy or the blacklist, but I'm sure you can imagine plenty of other cases where organisations will interpret the data or lists as they expect rather than intended.  The Law of Unintended Consequences will apply, and as they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions",

We should be trying to understand from breaches, trying to work out what happened and what was involved, and what steps we could take that would prevent it next time.\r\n\r\nTo do that, tradition says that we need to balance our advice and our security concerns against the usability of the systems, but as Emma W from NCSC says so well this week, that's a false dichotomy.  We need to work out how to make our systems more resilient, and more usable in the most secure manner.  We need to meet users where they are and ensure that they can easily patch, update and authenticate, in a manner that works for them and helps them remain secure.  Security isn't a tradeoff against usability, but it is inextricably linked.\r\n\r\nAnd if we don't do this soon, then we'll see another attack the scale of NotPetya, and we'll see more of them, and as the gloves come off in an international arena, we'll see growing escalation, but more importantly, the vulnerabilities, the weapons that are being used in the shadowy online conflict will fall into the hands of truly bad people who don't care about \"collateral damage\" and just want profit at any cost.",

We don't have consistent definitions of a breach, is emailing that spreadsheet to someone on purpose a breach? How about if someone outside the organisation got cc'd by mistake on an email thread? What about if a security researcher found a vulnerabiity and responsibly disclosed it to us?\r\nGiven even this, how are we to take statistics about the number of breaches, the average cost of breaches, or almost any other number in cybersecurity seriously?\r\n\r\nEven worse, as you'll see in the ONS survey below, when we ask users questions, they have a different context in mind.  One of the questions asked if users had \"antispam\" software on their phone, and I made a joke about it in a Slack instance, for someone to remind me of those apps that identify incoming callers that are unwanted sales calls.  If I had that software on my phone, and someone asked me if I had an \"antispam\" app, I would never associate the two and answer in the negative.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, there's a few interesting tools that have been released.  I'd like to highlight a couple of tools each week, but I don't run across new tools as often as I read articles, so please send me recommendations of tools you use on a regular basis that you think should be shared, and I'll add them.",

I don't think there has been enough public discourse about what is an acceptable or unacceptable target in the cyberwarfare domain.  Is it acceptable to breach a commercial entity if a military target is using it to coordinate kinetic offensive missions?  Is it different if it's a large Us entity like WhatsApp versus a small regional entity?   What level of collatoral damage is acceptable?\r\nJust like with target strikes and kinetic warfare, this isn't easily black and white, but shades of grey and public opinion will shift and change over time, influenced by the media of course, but it's probably a public debate that is overdue",

For me, I read the Motherboard article first, but then the Reddit incident and the claim last week from Google made me perk up my ears, and then the internet exploded with comment about two-factor authentication.  In my original comments against these articles I kept asking the question \"It might not be brilliant, but isn't it worse if we don't use it?\"\r\n\r\nI now feel confident that I'm not the only person asking this question, and that actually we all agree that not using a security control because it's not perfect is a terrible approach.\r\n\r\nWe desperately need better two-factor authentication mechanisms that work for users, wherever they are and no matter how technically literate they are, and sadly there is no near ubiquity of modern U2F FIDO dongles like UbiKey's or Googles recently announced Titan keys.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this week, I've been reading and thinking a lot about careers in cybersecurity and what career pathways should look like.  You can expect some of that reading in next weeks issue, but some tidbits have snuck in here.\r\n\r\nEnjoy",

And you don\u2019t trust them forever; you trust them for as long as certain risk-related conditions are true. You might stop trusting them in cases where enough time has passed that their password might have been compromised, or when their endpoint becomes vulnerable to a certain exploit by virtue of its software becoming outdated.\n\nThis is the reason why network perimeter-based security is less than optimal: organizations tend to trust a user forever, to do anything, as long as they come from the right IP address and give the right password.

We have observed spear-phishing campaigns that target human resources and hiring managers, IT staff, and internal information security staff, which are generally very effective.  In 2017 the entity focused most of its efforts around technical job applicant email submissions to software engineering, IT, and recruiting staff, which we originally reported on at our 401trg.com blog.\u201d  This is an interesting report.  I\u2019m not entirely convinced by the tying together of all of the activities into a single group, but that\u2019s not what is interesting to me.  Again what I see here is that APT level actors are interested in things like code signing certificates and developer workflows and tool chains.  The sending of phishing emails to recruitment email addresses feels particularly devious.  A recruitment manager would both be expected to open any attachment on an email like this and would very likely collate documents such as CV\u2019s and send them onto internal engineers for sifting, probably without editing or changing the documents.  That potentially malicious file being passed internally from a \u201ctrusted source\u201d is a fascinating insight into how high end phishing or spear phishing can work.",

In order to create transparency for executives, you need an expert who can extract the data you need to create the views they need. One of the graduates working with us created an app to extract data from Jira into an SQL based database. Once the data was in the SQL database it took a couple of days to create an excel report that gave an executive view of lead time using weighted lead time.\u201d. There is quite a lot of interesting bits and pieces in here about transformation and transparency, but this caught my eye.  How often do we see agile teams grumble that the executives or leaders could come down and see the \u201cwall\u201d?  What our teams often fail to realise is that the wall of cards, or tool like Jira, is optimised to be used by the day to day users of the thing.  There is a value in senior leaders seeing that, to ensure that they aren\u2019t being hoodwinked, and to understand where the \u201croll up\u201d numbers come from, but actually, burn down charts, story estimation, velocity or other summation metrics are far more useful for these leaders, and creating those metrics, those dashboards takes time, energy and effort.  As an agile team, you need to put in that energy or effort.  Simply grumbling that the leadership don\u2019t come to your show and tell, or don\u2019t come and walk the wall wont lead to success",

The first being that this is a pattern that has previously only been understood and applied generally in classified environments, and so to have it so clearly articulated in a manner that is sharable and discussable is really useful.\n\n\u201cThe pattern is generic, so should be tailored to fit your particular scenario. In lower risk situations, you might want to leave out some of the controls\" This is important guidance for the use of a pattern like this.  Too often in Government, I run into security people whose attitude to patterns and pronouncements from NCSC, NIST, NSA etc is to assume that these are cast iron checklists that must be obeyed, and the context is lost.  This blog makes it clear that this pattern outlines the pattern, but you might need to modify it to suit your circumstances.\n\n\"One top tip I\u2019d like to share from my experience of using the pattern is to remind users to ask for the data they need, rather than the document it's wrapped in. I\u2019ve often heard requirements for regular PDF transfers, when what is actually needed is some text, or numbers contained within a PDF. The data might arrive in a PDF, but that\u2019s not necessarily what's required to pass through your gateway.\u201d This second bit is also a useful reminder.  If you current accept documents in complex formats, such as Word, ODF, PDF, XLS etc, then think whether you should be asking your systems, users or staff submitting those documents what they actually need.  Often times you could make like easier for the user, less data to find and submit, and clearer how the data will be used, as well as making the whole system more secure by requesting a subset of the data be manually entered instead.",

Most of the security or information assurance teams I've met in Government are the last to adopt any new technology.  The security teams refuse to use Trello because its \"not secure enough\", and they still retain security documentation on shared drives on the corporate server, with no indexes, no search and limited capability to look stuff up.  This is often touted as necessary because the security documents contain sensitive information such as the IP addresses of internal servers (shock horror), or lists of known vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBut when the security teams don't use the tooling that everyone else uses, how can they possibly be expected to give any advice on how to use that tooling appropriately and securely?  How can they help the organisation use the newest and latest technology?  I think security teams should be using modern tooling, and trying new task trackers, todo lists, collaboration tools to find out how to use them well, and how users might use them.",

Writing policies that nobody will read, checking contracts for breach clauses despite being confident the contract wont be breached, adding malware protection to servers and desktops that shouldn't be able to have malware on them.\r\nWhat if we just stopped doing some of this stuff and looked at what things we could do that would massively improve security overall?  Paid to upgrade and patch servers and desktops, bought everyone working good security software, ran education programs to help people do their jobs more efficiently and safely?\r\n\r\nSadly this isn't possible, but I wonder what we would spend our time and money on if it wasn't all taken up with the stuff that we feel we are required to do?",

Ticketmaster claim it wasn't their breach, but one of their suppliers, the supplier admits being hacked but claims it wasn't their responsibility as they didn't recommend putting the javascript onto the payment processing pages.\r\n\r\nAs the complexity of web applications and technology estates grows, it's going to become harder and harder to work out the impact of a breach, and to determine who is responsible for keeping the users data safe.  The world we live in is complex and difficult, and nothing will ever be clear and simple about this stuff.\r\n\r\nIn newsletter news, a few people haven't got some of the more recent editions.  I contacted TinyLetter and the best they could recommend was to add cyberweekly@brunton-spall.co.uk to your address book which should whitelist it from spam filters.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy this weeks reading and analysis",

Yet the risk leader and the risk function often lack the access to data, the analytical firepower, and the ability to communicate with management and the organization in real time or near-real time. A successful risk reboot empowers the risk leader with ready access to risk and performance data, analytical tools, and reporting mechanisms such as data visualization. Equally important, the risk leader and his or her team should be prepared to provide early warnings of emerging risks to further support decision-making\u2014perhaps with an assist from risk-sensing technologies, predictive analytics, and scenario planning\u2014along with actionable insights and recommendations.\r\n\r\nScenario planning in particular can enable risk leaders to clearly portray the impact of potential risk events on specific stakeholders. It enables management to more clearly understand the full range of available options as well as the if-then ramifications of each decision. Scenario planning also enables leaders to define potential signals that, if they were to emerge, might indicate the nature and impact of potential risks as well as the direction of future events.",

It's not about whether tools are hosted on an AWS IaaS.  It's about purchasing tools or systems as services, where a third party is responsible for all of the security of the data and the service, in isolation from everything else.\r\n\r\nThis is the doublethink of \"zero-trust\", it's actually about massively increasing your trust.  Increasing your trust in third parties to protect your data, and decreasing your trust that you can do a better job of that on your own network.  We stop trusting that our devices, on our network, can access our data on our servers.  Instead we assume that any or every part of that can be compromised, and we invest in attestion, detection and remediation technologies to partition services, clients and devices into trust zones or areas dynamically.",

Security isn\u2019t something you can just \u2018do.\u2019 Sure, you may be able to buy security tools or products. As a security professional, you might have a lot of experience at adjusting firewall or provisioning policies, or have specialized training to investigate incidents. While these things can be helpful in applying security to your organization\u2019s business practices, they are not really advancing the business in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThat is an important distinction and provides the basis of our view of zero trust. Zero trust isn\u2019t something you can buy or implement. It\u2019s a philosophy and a strategy. And to be frank, at IBM, we wouldn\u2019t even characterize zero trust as a security strategy. It\u2019s an IT strategy done securely.\r\n\r\nCloud First \u2014 More than an IT Strategy\r\nConsider this. For the last several years, our IT strategy has followed a simple rule: cloud first. Everything we build or buy \u2014 from our marketing tools to our developer technology to our collaboration applications \u2014 is delivered as a service or is available to be hosted on our public cloud.",

State and non-state actors must not pursue, support or allow cyber operations intended to disrupt the technical infrastructure essential to elections, referenda or plebiscites.\r\n1. State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace.\r\n1. State and non-state actors should not commandeer the general public\u2019s ICT resources for use as botnets or for similar purposes.\r\n1. States should create procedurally transparent frameworks to assess whether and when to disclose not publicly known vulnerabilities or flaws they are aware of in information systems and technologies. The default presumption should be in favor of disclosure.\r\n1. Developers and producers of products and services on which the stability of cyberspace depends should (1) prioritize security and stability, (2) take reasonable steps to ensure that their products or services are free from significant vulnerabilities, and (3) take measures to timely mitigate vulnerabilities that are later discovered and to be transparent about their process. All actors have a duty to share information on vulnerabilities in order to help prevent or mitigate malicious cyber activity.\r\n1. States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene.\r\n1. Non-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent such activities and respond if they occur.",

On the other hand, as Tinker points out further down in the thread, dressed as cleaners in predominately white offices, they can slip by unnoticed.  As a pentesting firm, you have to consider both the danger of the environment and safety of the participants, but physical pen testing is about hacking peoples minds as much as picking locks.

            "quote": "As part of the work for Firefox 3, which introduced Places, Mozilla worked to generalize how it handled recording the logic for ccTLDs, introducing with it the notion of the \u201ceffective TLD.\u201d By extracting the logic from the cookie processing algorithm itself, this allowed Mozilla to group cookies and other settings across more easily managed logical boundaries, without having to duplicate the logic or come up with new heuristics. The \u201ceffective TLD\u201d took into consideration ccTLD\u2019s registration policies, which were painstakingly determined over the span of several months, and which ultimately gave birth to what we now know as the Public Suffix List (PSL).\r\n\r\nParallel to this work, the notion of the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) was evolving. Michal Zalewski\u2019s Browser Security Handbook best captures this evolution, which was not a single policy, but a number of similar policies, such as around document.domain, XMLHttpRequest, and various plugins. Unlike cookies, which considered the boundary to be the \u201cregistered domain,\u201d the SOP focused specifically on the combination of scheme, host, and port being an \u201cexact\u201d match1.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the divergence between how the SOP is applicable in different contexts has been reduced, such that there are, effectively, two main security boundaries in the Web today: the SOP boundary (e.g. as used by fetch()/XMLHttpRequest/CORS) and the cookie boundary (quasi-shared with document.domain). As a consequence, browser developers who want to introduce new features are faced with a question: Should that feature use the origin as the boundary (implying the SOP) or should it use the \u201cregistrable domain\u201d as the boundary (implying the PSL)?",

How imperfect? That depends on the application. 90-95% accuracy is achievable in many applications, maybe even 99%, but never 100%. That doesn't mean machine learning applications aren't useful. It does mean we have to be aware that machine learning is never going to be a 100% solution, particularly as we rush to use it in applications as diverse as\u00a0sentencing criminals\u00a0and\u00a0planning menus. What are the error rates, and can we tolerate them? Are error rates higher on some portions of the population than others? I don't care too much if Amazon recommends books I don't want to buy or if a menu has items I don't want to eat. But accuracy is far more important in many other applications of AI. Face recognition systems used in law enforcement have long had problems with racial bias. That article notes a study\u00a0showing that systems developed in China, Japan, and South Korea were much better at identifying East Asian faces than Caucasian ones. Another study shows that face recognition software in use by police departments performs significantly worse on black faces. This undoubtedly has an effect on criminal convictions.",

Let me close by trying to give you a leg up in crafting good strategies, which have a basic underlying structure:\r\n\r\n1. A diagnosis: an explanation of the nature of the challenge. A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as being the critical ones.\r\n\r\n2. A guiding policy: an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n3. Coherent actions: steps that are coordinated with one another to support the accomplishment of the guiding policy.\r\n\r\n",

At some point, the victim _may_ be notified (the EU General Data Protection Regulation says \"when the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.\" [Article 34](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/)) but probability of risk ('likely') is hard to calculate, as is consequence-to-breach attribution and 'undue delay' is certainly up in the air.\r\n\r\nCompanies have offered identity protection services to data subjects (but generally offered only for a year and of course required data subject opt-in to use the service) but this simply does, nor cannot, go far enough in protecting them from potentially years of consequence.",
